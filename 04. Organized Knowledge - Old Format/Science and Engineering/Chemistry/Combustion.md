- Combustion requires
	- Oxidising agent to sustain combustion
	- Fuel as a combustible material
	- Heat to raise an object to its ignition temperature
	- An exothermic chemical reaction that is fire.
- These four elements form the combustion tetrahedron.

## Fire extinguishers
They take away one or more elements from the combustion tetrahedron.
