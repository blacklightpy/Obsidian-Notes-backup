**Chemical potential**, or more specifically the **total chemical potential** of a species is the total amount of energy that is absorbed or released during a change in the number of particles of that species (e.g. due to a reaction or phase change).

It was first described by the American engineer, chemist and mathematical physicist **Josiah Willard Gibbs**.

Chemical potential is also referred to as **partial molar Gibbs energy** ($\text{E/mol}$).
# Formula
The chemical potential, ${\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {B}}}$, of a substance $\text{B}$ in an ideal mixture of liquids or an ideal solution is given by:

${\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {B} }=\mu _{\mathrm {B} }^{\ominus }+\text{RT}\chi_{\mathrm {B}}}$,

where $\chi$ is the chemical potential of a pure substance ${\displaystyle \mathrm {B} }$, and ${\displaystyle \chi_{\mathrm {B} }}$ is the mole fraction of the substance in the mixture.

This is generalized to include non-ideal behavior by writing:

${\displaystyle \mu = \mu_{\mathrm{ideal}}+\mu_{\mathrm{excess}}}$,
${\displaystyle \Rightarrow \mu_\text{ideal} = \mu^\ominus + \text{RT}\ln\chi}$, and
$\displaystyle \Rightarrow \mu_\text{excess}=\text{RT}\ln\gamma$
$\displaystyle \Rightarrow \mu=\mu^\ominus + \text{RT}\ln\chi + \text{RT}\ln\gamma$
$\displaystyle \Rightarrow \mu=\mu^\ominus + \text{RT}\ln\chi\gamma$

${\displaystyle \therefore \mu _{\mathrm {B} }=\mu _{\mathrm {B} }^{\ominus }+\text {RT} \ln a_{\mathrm {B}}}$,

when ${\displaystyle a_{\mathrm {B} }}$ is the **activity** of the substance in the mixture,

${\displaystyle a_{\mathrm {B} }=\chi_{\mathrm {B} }\gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$,

${\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$ will be the **activity coefficient**, which may itself depend on ${\displaystyle \chi_{\mathrm {B} }}$. As ${\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$ approaches 1, the substance behaves as if it were ideal.

For instance, if ${\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$ ≈ 1, then [[Raoult's Law]] is accurate. For ${\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$ > 1 and ${\displaystyle \gamma _{\mathrm {B} }}$ < 1, substance B shows positive and negative deviation from Raoult's law, respectively. A positive deviation implies that substance B is more volatile.

In many cases, as ${\displaystyle \chi_{\mathrm {B} }}$ goes to zero, the activity coefficient of substance B approaches a constant; this relationship is Henry's law for the solvent. These relationships are related to each other through the Gibbs–Duhem equation.
# Notes

The total chemical potential can be divided into the **internal and external chemical potentials**.

In fields such as electrochemistry, semiconductor physics and solid state physics, the term chemical potential means just the internal chemical potential.

[[Electrochemical Potential]] is an example of total chemical potential.

In semiconductor physics, the chemical potential of a system of electrons at zero absolute temperature is known as the [[Fermi level]].
