The van 't Hoff factor is the ratio between the actual concentration of particles produced when the substance is dissolved and the concentration of a substance as calculated from its mass.

For most non-electrolytes dissolved in water, the van 't Hoff factor is essentially 1. 

The value is different for **association** and **dissociation** of solutes. (Fill in later)
