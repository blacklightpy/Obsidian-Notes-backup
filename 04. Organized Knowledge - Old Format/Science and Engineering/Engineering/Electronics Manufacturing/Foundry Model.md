The companies that only design chips are called **fabless companies**.
e.g.: AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm

The companies that manufacture chips are divided into two types:

**Pure Play foundries**
They don't design chips themselves, but they manufacture designs for other companies.
- e.g.: TSMC, UMC, GlobalFoundries, IBM (used to be)

**Integrated Device Manufacturers**
They are companies that design and manufacture chips in house.
