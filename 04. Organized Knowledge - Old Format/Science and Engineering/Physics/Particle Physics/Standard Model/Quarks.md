- They have the spin quantum number of 1/2
- They have [[Color Charge]]
- They have fractional electric charges
- They participate in strong interactions
### Three generations (+2/3 and -1/3 electric charges respectively)
1. Up and Down

and their respective anti-particles. Anti-quarks have the same mass, mean lifetime and spin, but have opposite electric charges and colour charges.

There are 6 distinct types of quarks, and together with their colour charge and anti-quark variants, there are 36 types of quarks.
