An effective field theory is an approximation of a physical theory such as [[Quantum Field Theory]] or statistical mechanics to describe a certain phenomenon in a simplified manner, for specific cases.

Both [[Quantum Field Theory]] and the theory of general relativity can be seen as effective theories of the still unknown theory of everything.
