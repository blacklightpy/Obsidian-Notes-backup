The ΛCDM model or Lamba-CDM model is a parameterization of the [[Big Bang Theory]] cosmological model in which the universe contains three components:
- A cosmological constant associated with dark energy, denoted by Λ (lambda)
- The postulated cold dark matter
- Ordinary matter

It is referred to as the standard model of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that explains the following phenomena of the cosmos:
- The existence and structure of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
- The large scale structure in the distribution of galaxies
- The abundance of light elements such as Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium and Deuterium
- The accelerating expansion of the universe observed in the light from distant galaxies and supernovae

This model assumes that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity at cosmological scales.
