# Malu's Law
Light from the polarizer is incident on the analyzer

- $I = I_0\cos^2{\theta_i}$  , $I_0$ is the initial intensity; $\theta_i$ is the angle between the plane of the polarizer and the analyzer.
- For a beam of unpolarized light, it contains light from all angles, so the value of $\cos^2{\theta}$ can be thought of as the average, which is $1/2$
  
  Hence, $I/I_0 = 1/2$ 

## Proof of Malu's Law
- $I = A^2$ , $I$ is the intensity, $A$ is the amplitude
- The electric vector of a light has an amplitude of $E_0$. This can be decomposed into $E_0\cos{\theta}$ and $E_0\sin{\theta}$, $\theta$ being the angle between the direction of oscillation of the light wave and the plane of the polarizer
- The polarizer lets in the $E_0\cos{\theta}$ component and absorbs the $E_0\sin{\theta}$ component.
- $I_0 = (E_0\cos{\theta})^2$
- $I/I_0 = (E_0\cos{\theta})^2/E_0^2=\cos^2{\theta}$
