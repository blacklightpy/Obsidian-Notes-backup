- Quantum Mechanics requires an outside observer, but in General Relativity, there is no outside.

# My Ideas
I believe particles exist by warping spacetime, which is comprised of tiny vibrating strings or similar particles.

Larger particles are formed by combinations of particles, and hence by the stacking of warping, which leads to a larger warping of spacetime.

The nature of warping of particles are what gives some of these particles the phenomena we observe as charge.

Thus, charge is related to the warping of spacetime, as evidenced by the similarities between the interactions of charged particles and massive particles.

The same phenomena that attracts or repels charged particles is what attracts all particles. But as for explaining repulsion, and also how the attraction is weaker, I'm stuck for now. I may not be able to explain how charge arises now, however the analogy of warping of spacetime is still valid for the formation of particles.
