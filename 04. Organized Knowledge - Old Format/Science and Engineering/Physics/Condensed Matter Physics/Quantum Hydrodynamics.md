It is a branch of condensed matter physics that studies hydrodynamic-like systems which exhibit quantum mechanical behaviour.

One of the important areas of study in quantum hydrodynamics is that of [[Superfluidity]].

The equations of quantum hydrodynamics are called Madelung equations, and they are just quantum Euler Equations, which are Schrodinger's equations in the Bohmian interpretation written with hydrodynamic variables.
