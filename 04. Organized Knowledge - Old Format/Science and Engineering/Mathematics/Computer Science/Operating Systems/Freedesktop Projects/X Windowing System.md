X Windowing System, also known as X, takes a client-server architecture to handling graphics. It is the de-facto display protocol used by free UNIX-like operating systems.

It is officially being replaced by the newer [[Wayland]] protocol.

e.g.: Xlib, XCB (X C Bindings), XKB (X Keyboard Library, XFreeType (FreeType font library)
