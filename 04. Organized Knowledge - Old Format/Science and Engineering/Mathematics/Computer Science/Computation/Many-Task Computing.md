Many-Task Computing (MTC) tries to bridge the gap between [[High-Performance Computing]] and [[High-Throughput Computing]].

MTC is like HTC, but it has its speed measured in seconds (e.g. FLOPS, tasks/s, MB/s I/O rates)

It is used for high-performance computations comprising multiple distinct activities, coupled by file system operations.
