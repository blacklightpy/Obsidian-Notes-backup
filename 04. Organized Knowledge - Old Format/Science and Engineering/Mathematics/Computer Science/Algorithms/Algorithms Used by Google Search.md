This was a question asked to me by Kalra

- Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

**For extracting key points and descriptors:**
- "Principal Component Analysis" based "Scale Invariant Feature Transform" (PCA-SIFT)
- Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF)

**For Indexing and matching:**
- Locally-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

# Notes on the topic
In Computer Vision, SIFT is a [[Visual Descriptor|feature descriptor]].

**Other feature descriptors:**
- Group Invariant Feature Transform (GIFT)
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) ^ffb7e9
- Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF)
- Gradient Location and Orientation Histogram (GLOH)
- Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
- Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD)
