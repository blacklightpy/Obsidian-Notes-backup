## Parameters
- Focal Length
- [[Hyperfocal Distance]]
- **Circle of Confusion (CoC)**
	- When the converging point of the image cone is in front of or behind the focus, the image formed on the screen is a circle, not a point. This circle is called the Circle of Confusion.
- **Depth of Field (DOF)**
	- The distance between objects that create a focus range of acceptable circle of confusion is called depth of field. The region that is not in the focused range forms a [[Photography#^2ceb3b|bokeh]].

- **Aperture**
- [[Lens Mounts]]
## Types of Lenses
### By structure
- Convex | Concave
- Plano Convex | Plano Concave | Convexo-Concave | Concavo-Convex
- Fresnel Lens - thinned plano-convex lens, by cutting out rectangular segments, making no significant change in angle of refraction.
	- It has distortion which makes it bad for imaging applications
### By Functionality
- Fisheye Lenses / Ultra Wide Angle Lenses
- Wide Angle Lenses
- Telephoto Lenses
- Macro Lenses
