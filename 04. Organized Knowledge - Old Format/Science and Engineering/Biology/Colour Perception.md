### Colour Perception

#### Physiology
- Light sensitivity
	- Seeing Purple (source: https://www.quora.com/Why-does-purple-light-appear-blue-in-cameras/answer/Bill-Otto-5)
	- Human Eye Quantum Efficiency (see how cones percieve some blue light as red):

- Rod and Cone Cells
	- Cone Cells
		- Are three types - Short (S), Medium (M), Long (L)
		- Gives colour vision
		- Most are sensitive to 555 nm (Green)
	- Rod Cells
		- Gives low-light vision at 500 nm
#### Mathematics
- Physical color is a combination of pure spectral colours (in the visible range)
- Hilbert Space $H_{colour}$ (Infinite Dimensional Vector Space) holds all colours
- Euclidian Spaces
- Each element $C$ of $H_{colour}$ is a function that gives an interval of all the colours $[W_{min}, W_{max}]$ to real numbers $w$
- So human percievable colours can be modelled by 3 numbers, to the extend to which each cone cell - S,M,L is stimulated by a wavelength $w$ as $s(w)$, $m(w)$ and $l(w)$.
- This can be thought of as points in a 3-dimensional Euclidian Space, and we call this the ${R^3}_{colour}$
