A uniform colour space (UCS) is a [[Colour Models|colour model]] that seeks to make the colour-making attributes perceptually uniform, that is identical spatial distance between two colours in a color space equals identical amount of percieved [[Colour Difference]].

# Tolerance
It asks the question, what is the set of colours which are acceptably close to a given reference?

If distance measures are perceptually uniform throughout the gamut, then the set of points which are imperceptibly/acceptably close to a given reference are simply the set of points whose distance to the reference is less than the just-noticable-difference (JND).

The differences of sizes of tolerance contours signify non-uniformity of distance measures across the gamut, and that is what motivated the creation of [[CIELAB]] and [[CIELUV]]

A [[Colour Appearance Models|CAM]] under a fixed viewing condition results in a UCS; a UCS with a modelling of variable viewing conditions results in a CAM. A UCS without such modelling can also be a rudimentary CAM.
