CIE 1964 (U*, V*, W*) [[Colour Space]], also known as CIEUVW is based on the [[CIE 1960 Uniform Colour Space]].

$U^*=13W^*(u-u_0)$
$V^*=13W*(v-v_0)$
Where ($u_0,v_0$) is the white point snd Y is the luminous [[Tristimulus]] value of the object.

The asterisks in the exponent indicates that the variable represents a more [[Uniform Colour Spaces|perceptually uniform]] colour space than its predecessor.

Wyszecki invented the UVW colour space in order to be able to calculate [[Colour Difference|colour differences]] without having to hold the [[Lightness|luminance]] constant.

He defined a [[Lightness]] index W* by simplifying the expressions suggested earlier by Ladd and Pinney. The chromaticity components U* and V* are defined such that the [[White Point]] maps to the origin, as in [[Adams chromatic valence colour spaces]]
