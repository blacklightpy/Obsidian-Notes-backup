It is a colour space derived from the [[CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space|CIEXYZ]] colour space as a cross between XYZ and its normalized coordinates x, y and z, such that the luminance Y is preserved. It is widely used to specify colours in practice.

In the conversion, the X and Z [[Tristimulus]] values are coverted to [[Chromaticity]] values x and y. The Y value is the lightness, which is independent of the hues.

This allows all colours to be represented as in 2-Dimensions using a chromaticity diagram, which is just the cross section of xyY space without considering the Y components.

Mathemtically, the colours of the chromaticity diagram occupies a region of the [[Real Projective Plane]].
