A discipline is a branch of knowledge. Knowledge is a collection of information. Information refers to insights derived from observations.

**Etymology**
- discipline is derived from disciple - which means student.
- disciple is derived from the Latin word disciplicus, which also means student.

So a discipline can be thought of as a way of understanding the world in a way that someone else has understood it.

Disciplines are necessary for coexistence, since everyone percieves the world differently.
