Used for estimating returns on periodic investments in mutual funds etc.

If paid at the start of period,

A = P\*\[{(1+i)^n – 1 }/i\]\*(1+i)

If paid at the end of period,

A = P\*\[{(1+i)^n – 1 }/i\]

A = Final amount  
P = Installment each time  
n = Total number of installments  
i = Rate (in %) for period
