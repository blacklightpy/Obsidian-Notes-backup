# Details
## Sikhism
- Sikhism is an offshoot of Hinduism, but is monotheistic. It was influenced by Sufis, but not by Islam.
- Sikhism prohibits Halaal meat, because it hates ritualistic killing of animals.
- It also believes that when sin increases in earth, God will incarnate.
- It rejects the final word of god.
- It rejects the belief of lineage form Adam and Eve.
- It rejects circumcision and burial of the dead.
## Shinto
- It regards the Kami as the god
- It is nature itself, and can be seen as single or as multiple
- Western classification of it as polytheistic is not supported by Japanese people
## Shamanism
I usually like Shamanism, but there are downsides.
Like this exorcism ritual.

I guess, this is how human generally are when they start life.
This could also explain the rise of strict monotheistic religions.
