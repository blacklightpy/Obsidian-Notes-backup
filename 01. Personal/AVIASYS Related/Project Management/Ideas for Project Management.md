For our purposes, we'll be considering only Kanban and Scrum (and not other areas like XP).

We could also split some teams to go completely Agile, where it fits (eg: Software)
# Communication
- Slack/Discord (Sync)
- E-Mail/Trello (Async)
- Notion/Confluence (Docs)
# Using Scrum Methodology
(Adjusted for our workflow)
- Sprint Planning + Backlog pruning -> Monday
- Sprint Review -> Wednesday
- Sprint Retrospective -> Friday
# Reasons for Absences
* Personal vacations
* Holidays
* Other personal projects
* Flexibility in all that
* Mental health breaks
# Workplace Ideas
Incorporate healthy workplace habits like:

- 20-20-20 rule
- Ergonomic screens and furniture
- Pomodoro technique
- Stretching exercises
- Refreshment breaks
- Follow procedure under stress
