# Notes

## Types of 3D Modelling
- Point Clouds
	- Stores basic positional data
- Polygon Meshes
	- Points connected in Triangles
	- Mesh aka Subdivision Surface
	- Can contain properties like color
	- SolidWorks renders and models sent for 3D Printing are converted to polygons
- NURBS/Surfaces
	- Mathematical models
	- Have no resolution
	- Easy to edit since we're just changing curves
	- Rendered as polygon meshes
   
   A "solid" model in CAD programs is no different from a surface model, except it has some extras like volume parameter etc.
