# Frameworks
- PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive)
- GTD (Getting Things Done)
- Johnny Decimal

## Johnny Decimal
Johnny Decimal is an organization system, which is a simplification of the Dewey Decimal System, that goes like Category Slots (10) > Categories (10 Per Slot) > IDs (100 Per Category)

```
00-09 Index Category Slot
	01 Index Category 01
		01.01 Index ID 01.01
		...
	02 Index Category 02
	...
10-19 Category Slot 2
	11 Category 11
		11.01 Item ID 11.01
		...
	12 Category 12
	...
20-29 Category Slot 3
...
```

## PARA
PARA is a messy organization system, that goes like Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives. Some people also like to put Projects inside Areas, making it go like Projects > Areas, Resources, Archives.

## GTD
GTD is a task management system.

Things I need:
- Lists
	- Inbox
	- Waiting For List
	- Next Actions List
	- Projects List
	- Someday/Maybe List
	- Context-Specific List
	- Agenda-Specific List
- Calendar
- Trigger List
- Weekly Review
- Tickler List
### Guide
- In it, first you have to write down all your ideas.
	- All new ideas go in the ==inbox==, which you review at a specific time of the day.
- Next, you have to see whether the ideas in the ==inbox== are actionable or not.
	- If they are not, either trash them, or set them aside.
	- If they are, define the next physical action to move closer to its target
		- Next, see if the task can be completed in under two minutes.
			- If so, do it right away. (Why? Because tracking it will be more time consuming that the time to do it)
		- If not, see if it's a task that is meant for you.
			- If not, delegate it.
				- Add these tasks to the ==waiting for list==, and contact the person, and mark the current date on the item
		- If not, see if the task is urgent
			- If so, add it to the ==next actions list==
		- Next, see if there are multiple tasks required to complete a goal
			- If so, group them under a Project
				- If the project is active, move it to the ==projects list==
				- Otherwise, add it to the ==someday/maybe list==
			- Make sure every project has at least one action in the ==next actions list==.
		- If not, see if it is context-specific
			- If so, add it to the ==context-specific list==
		- If it is dependent on a next occurrence, add it to the ==agenda-specific list==
		- If it is not time dependent, add it to to a ==someday/maybe list==
		- If it is for a specific date, add it to the ==calendar==.

Next, you should review your lists every week.

- Make sure every project has at least one ==next action==.
- Make sure that each action on your ==next actions== list is still immediately relevant.
	- If not, move it it to the ==someday/maybe list== or trash it.
- See if any action on your ==someday/maybe== list should be added to your ==next actions list== or ==projects list==
	- If you're adding a new project to the ==projects list==, make sure it has at least one action in the ==next actions list==
- During weekly review, also populate a ==trigger list== which is a bunch of keywords about aspects of your life, which can make you remember things that you haven't captured.
	- If any new idea comes up while reading your ==trigger list==, put it in your ==inbox==

**Optional Tools:**
- Read/Review List: For reading/reviewing to-read lists [I don't need]
- Tickler List: 43 folders (31+12)
	- Put a reminder item in each day of the month + group others in the month specific folders.
	- On each day, open the day's folder and have the right stuff for the day's actions.
	- At the end of each month, open the next month's folder and arrange the files into the daily folders.

# Analogies with computer file systems

**Johnny Decimal:**

D: (System) > 100 Categories > Folder 1 > Content
(In practice, there will be generally 30 categories and 4-5 folders, which will have further nesting)

D: (System) > 10 Category Lists > Folders (10 Categories) > Folders (IDs) > Content

One difference is that usually, files are stored in folders that do not have a full Johnny Decimal address.

But definitely, we can draw some parallels as all of these are forms of information organization, and will have similar patterns.

(Forget my `D: > New Folder (2) > new2 > new > New Folder (3) > Content` XD)
