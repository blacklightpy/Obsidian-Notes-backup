### From Reddit:

1. A careful combination of tools might get you the most mileage, since they each excel at different things. I recommend these for a start:

	-   Scratch notes or loose text: Drafts
	-   Memos: Apple Notes  
	-   Notebooks: UpNote, Notebooks 10 or Zoho Notes
	-   Handwriting and annotation: Nebo, Goodnotes or Noteability
	-   Lightly-structured notes and wikis: Bear, Spaces.do
	-   Highly linked notes: RemNote, Rome Research, Obsidian
	-   Outlines: Workflowy, RemNote, OmniOutliner
	-   Flash cards: Anki, RemNote
	-   Journal: DayOne or Journey
	-   Audio notes: Drafts, Noted

2. Android-verse

	- Google Keep for lists, todo, small notes.  
	- One Google Sheet, napkin, for things, ideas.  
	- Memorix for shopping lists

3. If you are using chrome or Edge browser, you can give try to a note-taking browser extension "Roughbook". You can download it from [Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roughbook-quick-notes-tak/phomkpbjipcgmfpffhkaphddmclefofh)
