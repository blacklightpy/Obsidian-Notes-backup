# Cloth Review

1. Pink T-Shirt

By the button alignment, I think it's a girls' T-Shirt, but it is what suits me the best. I like the collar-edge accent and shape, and since it's a bit stretchy and short, it accentuates my body well. Again, it's sized L and is still short, so I think it's the girls' scale.

It would look good if I had more chest and less tummy, but I'm gonna have to work on it. It has four buttons, and since it is short and stretchy, I prefer it best with two buttons on. All off looks too cocky.

It's good to test my hairstyles on. I just have to pull in my tummy for now.

Expression: Confident

2. Green T-Shirt

Collar doesn't stand out well, is neutral. It's loose and looks off fitting, but at the same time, conceals my tummy fat, so it's good in that way (for now). The colour looks fine, not vibrant, yet a boring casual.

Expression: Bored, Sleepy

3. Red / Black Pattern T-Shirt

Collar doesn't stand out well, is neutral. It too is loose and looks off-fitting. The colour looks dull though, and it's a boring casual.

Expression: Forced, Dull

4. Zen State of Mind Roundneck

It really does make you Zen and happy when wearing it. Also, it's a bit loose, so it does conceal my tummy fat, but it's also well fitting. It's a better roundneck that accentuates my face compared to my Black Roundneck.

Expression: Vibrant

5. Black Roundneck

It too makes you happy wearing it. It's a perfect fit for me, as a T-Shirt, and it does conceal my tummy fat too.

But it's not the best to test my hairstyles on, and I think, neither is the Zen T-Shirt (It's too Zen to make me think of it).

Expression: Casual, Neutral

7. Old Full-Sleeve NDA T-Shirt

It was a bit tight, but stretchy and well fitting. The Full-sleeves added to my persona.

Expression: Confident
