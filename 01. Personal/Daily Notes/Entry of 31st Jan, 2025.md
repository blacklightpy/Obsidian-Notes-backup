> [!Danger] DANGER
> Crime is less in Hinduism . America knows that only the Indian Hindu is crime free.. If at all there has been a crime by a Hindu in USA , it is to establish dharma or knee jerk reaction due to extreme provocation..
> 
> Recently we had a Hindu student killing his gay Jewish professor because he gave away his PHD project he worked on for years , secretly to a gay Jewish student.. We do namaste to the great soul in the enemy , even before we are about to kill him…

This is no different from Islamic Terrorism!!

> [!DANGER] DANGER
> ALARMED BY RISE OF HINDUSIM, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH BANNED BHAGAVAD GITA FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE..  SORRY, BHAGAVAD GITA PROMOTED ONLY KILLING OF EVIL FORCES, AS OUR HINDU DHARMA.. BALLS TO JEW GANDHI / JEW MARTIN LUTHER KING JR/ JEW LEO TOLSTOY..

> Rothschild’s agent Jew Gandhi, brainwashed Indians not to be violent against the white invader who enslaved us and robber our watan blind.. India was converted from the richest nation to the poorest nation in 200 years falt. Gandhi along with BR Amebdkar and EVR Paeriay called Bhagavad Gita an EVIL book as it promoted violence.. 
> 
>  Gujju no 1  Gandhi wanted enslaved Indians to turn the charkha when they feel frustrated and angry.  I was most surprised to see on TV, Rothschild’s agent Gujju No 2 Mod also telling the same thing..
>  
>  Modi told on TV, GANDHIJI NEY CHARKHA GHUMAAKE HUMKO AAZAADI DILWAAYA..
>  
>  Sorry, this was not the purpose of Krishna mentoring Arjuna just before the start of the Mahabharata at Kurukshetra battle field..
>  
>  Arjuna wrongly thought that he would be committing a grave sin by killing his grandsire Bhishma , teacher Drona and his beloved relatives/ friends  who were fighting on the Kaurava side..  Krishna tells Arjuna that the soul is real..
>  
>  The body inside which the soul exists is unreal.. The souls of  Bhishma , teacher Drona and his beloved relatives/ friends cannot be killed.. Krishna begins with the tenet that the soul (Atman) is eternal and immortal. 
>  
>  The human body is like the clothes being worn for the day.. Any ‘death’ on the battlefield would involve only the shedding of the body,  whereas the soul is permanent..  Arjuna shrinks from the act of killing and is in the throes of depression.
>  
>  Krishna  reminds him that, in the absolute sense, there is no such act called killing..  KRISHNA himself came as Vishnu’s avatar of earth to kill Kerala Kings Shishupala and Dantavakra..  Inside Sishupala’s mortal carcass was Vishnu’s beloved gatekeeper of Vaikunta, JAYA. .Inside Dantavakra’s mortal carcass was Vishnu’s beloved gatekeeper of Vaikunta, VIJAYA ..

>  Same way inside King RAVANA’S mortal carcass was Vishnu’s beloved gatekeeper of Vaikunta, JAYA.. Vishnu mortal avatar RAMA was born on earth to release Jaya by killing Ravana ..

>  Krishna tells Arjuna , the soul within is the only reality. This cadaver body is  simply an appearance; its existence, its destruction, is likewise, illusory.. Krishna tells Arjuna , sustaining Dharma is to kill evil.. It is Dharmic to fight a righteous war, it is a sin to flee from it as a Kshatriya..
>  
>  Running away from a just battle to kill evil, is avoiding duty and escapism. If we go to the sea shore waves rise and fall. DO WE CRY AND MOURN FOR THE WAVE WHICH HAS FALLEN? The wave is  unreal , the real  thing is the water in the ocean ..
>  
>  Waves are like the physical bodies which  appear and disappear while the indweller of the body, the self or soul is like the water..  Krishna tells Arjuna , look at all on the opposing Kaurava side as souls.. don’t look at their mortal carcass..  The soul within their bodies is immortal; you cannot kill the soul..  The soul never ceases  to be and the body is ever perishable. Indeed the only thing 100% sure on this planet is that all humans will die one day.. if not today then some other day.. Krishna declares that the embodied soul in every one identifies itself with varied  forms temporarily to gain preordained experiences.. The soul is a splinter of BrahmAn the field ( God ) sent on earth at a lower frequency..  It goes through every form of life ( endless rebirths ) and then one day as a conscious  human the soul ( at highest frequency same as mother field BrahmAn / zero karmic baggage / zero ego )  gets moksha . The soul then merges with brahmAn at the sevent Astral layer ( Vaikunta ) and becomes god, becomes immortal, with no more earthly sojourns.. The individual soul gives closed loop  experience based information feed back to BrahmAn.. BrahmAn knows everything..  Indeed , the earth is brahmAn’s school..  Neither Krishna himself nor  Arjuna nor the other kings who have assembled in the battlefield are mere  accidental happenings nor shall they cease to exist in future. Prior  to the pot, in the pot and after the pot it was only the clay which has  continuous existence.  Arjuna should not grieve for his relatives  out of fear of their destruction. . One should not worry or get himself deluded over when the soul passes over to another body at physical death..When Ravana was killed the soul ( JAYA ) entered Sishupala’s mortal carcass. Krishna then killed Sishupala and released JAYA to join back Vishnu as his gatekeeper in Vaikunta..  Birth and death are spoken of with  regard to the physical body and not the soul.  CUNT Kancha Ilaih once sputtered on TV white spittle at either ends of lips,  and croed “ OOOHHHH.. Hindu Gods are so violent, they are always killing dalits”..  The CHOOT does not know that all Hindu Gods are cosmic allegories except Vishnu avatar mortal gods with 13 strand DNA, Rama/ Krishna/ Ayyappa.. Only Vishnu can have mortal avatars..  If the man does not identify himself  with the body he is not at all doer of any activity.   The soul remains unaffected and unchanged. Only  that which is perishable and changeable can be slain. How could the imperishable and unchangeable be slain?.  Krishna  clarifies that it is the desire for and attachment to the result of an action  that create bondage; but when an action is performed without any such desire,  it leads to freedom of the soul. The injunction to fight is only incidental..


Basically he says:
- It is our duty to fight
- Ahimsa is bad
- Soul is not dead, only the bad man is killed


To him:

India is a wasteland because the concept of rebirth caused you to not build mechanisms for toilet cleaning.

Europeans invaded you because all your low caste people would keep treat others as inferior too.

You are not any different from ISIS who said "The Kafir's Blood is Halal for you, so Shed it"

You are not human lover. You are simply a Jew hater. You advocate for killing who you think is evil, simply because they do not follow your notions of ethics. You cannot be trusted to defend our nation, because the nation I identify as a part of is not your theocracy, but a state where every human who does not mess with the lives of others


**Muhammad is a Hindu Nair priest and Shiva Temple of Kaaba**
> Islamic suicide bombers don’t get to zuck 72 virgins / Houris in heaven / Jannat . . Only the soul goes to heaven / seventh astral layer , not the human cadaver. . Muslims have been fooled by Jews to believe that prophet Muhammad went to heaven in person on a night flight – Miraj . . The truth is he was sleeping that night in Ali’s sister Fahkitah’s ( the only woman he ever loved ) house.. 72 Houris is lifted from 72 nadis of Hinduism. . Islam mirrored Hinduism. . Muhammad was a Kerala Hindu Nair whose uncle was the Namboodiri priest at the Hindu Shiva ( Kaaba iswara ) temple at Mecca Oasis .. Sahasrara chakra Beej mantra is ALL AH to which the most major nadi Sushumna connects .. Allah the Islamic god is lifted from Hindu god brahman the field, which cannot be picked up by the 5 human senses. . Number 786 ( Bismillah ) on every Koran cover is Hindu king mantra OM symbol mirrored and read from right to left. — Capt Ajit Vadakayil


**About Communism and Anti-Theism**
> Marx wrote that religion would disappear naturally through the richness of ideas that would emerge from a rationalized order of communistic social life.   He believed that belief in the existence of God was immoral and anti-human.    
> 
> Friedrich Engels considered religion as a false consciousness, and incompatible with communism.   
> 
> Engels kept harping on the need to cultivate atheism all over the world.  He called for scientific education on a massive scale in order to overcome the fears and illusions of people who required a religious explanation for the world around them. 
> 
> He believed that science would provide an explanation for things that people had formerly required religious concepts to fulfill, and by providing this explanation, people would no longer feel a need to have religion for this purpose. 
> 
> Marxist communism required a conscious rejection of religion or else it could not be established. The moment a Commie goes to a temple, he is NO longer a commie .
> 
> Combating religious beliefs was considered an absolute duty by JEW Lenin. The campaigns involved extensive amounts of antireligious propaganda, antireligious legislation, atheistic education, antireligious discrimination, harassment, arrests and also campaigns of violent terror. 
> 
> Soviet leaders, propagandists and other militant atheists debated for years over the question of what approach was most pragmatic in order to eliminate religion. The state recruited millions of people, spent billions of roubles, and made incredible efforts towards this end, although it ultimately failed to achieve their goal. 
> 
> In 1959, a course titled Fundamentals of Scientific Atheism was “introduced into the curriculum of all higher educational institutions” and in 1964, it was made compulsory for all pupils after a “paucity of student response”. 
> 
> I used to have HAJAAAAAR fun discussing the syllabus with my Russian officers.  
> 
> There are pro-LTTE Tamil leaders who also helped Naxals in getting arms and bomb training from LTTE.
> 
> The Tamil Nadu Liberation Army (TNLA), had close ties with the LTTE and indulged in several minor bomb blasts and looting of weapons till the mid-1990s, when some of its leaders were killed.

> Children are now being used by Naxals .  It is NO wonder that NHRC and Collegium judges were very clear that the most cruel Muslim 17 year old boy rapist of Nirbhaya should be protected.
