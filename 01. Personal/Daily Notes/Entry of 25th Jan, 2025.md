From today, I will document my flow of thought in journal entries.

Today, I need to take notes on:
- Ballistics
- Action, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics
	- As I was looking about this, I found:
		- Absement, Actergy, etc.

Then do my todos, it's in Plasma Sticky Notes

Hard Cask
Full Metal Jacket

Glock 44 Magnum
Smith and Wesson 45 Magnum
12 Guage Shotgun / 1 oz slug

Depending on the target, we want to distribute the energy to lethal levels to key points.
e.g. Shooting a brick wall with a shotgun may not work, but it will work on a drywall
e.g. Shooting a brick wall with a rifle may work, but it will not work best for a drywall

So balance between speed, distribution and energy.
