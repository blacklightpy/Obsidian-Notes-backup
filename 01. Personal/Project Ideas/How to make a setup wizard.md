The idea is to trust developer binaries.

We can do that for free software too.

In Blacklight OS, we prefer to place trust in humanity, although we can audit the source.

I haven't developed a file system hierarchy for Blacklight OS.

A program in Linux will install to /usr/bin /usr/share /usr/lib and /usr/include in a system install, and to ~/.local/bin ~/.local/share ~/.config for a local install.

Similarly, FreeBSD would have its own folders.

For this reason, my setup wizard will let me install programs to Blacklight OS to the system, user or any other path, and add it to the system package manager.

It will also allow the user to install it to any other system, and might optionally be able to integrate it with the package manager.

The wizard creator would also unsurprisingly allow a creator to set which all operating systems the installer has support for. He would choose the operating systems from a drop-down list to avoid listing too many separately.

The user also will have to choose a dropdown list if they are installing to another OS.
