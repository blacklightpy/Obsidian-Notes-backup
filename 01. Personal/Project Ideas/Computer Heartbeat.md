I propose that every computer should have a heartbeat system, which allows to user to see when the computer is at state of heavy load.

This is similar to :
- The human heartbeat
- The blinking cursor
- The chassis LED light

Calling it a heartbeat should not cause confusion, because under the non-dualist framework, all entities share the same principles.
