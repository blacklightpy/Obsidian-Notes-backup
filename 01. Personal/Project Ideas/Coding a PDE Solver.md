Purpose (reason): To help solve equations to solve mathematical models.
Purpose (as a system): To solve [[Partial Differential Equations]].
How: For non [[NP-Completeness|NP-complete]] equations usually approximate them using [[Finite Element Method]] (FEM).
# Applications
- [[Finite Element Method]] in general
- [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]], which uses FVM
