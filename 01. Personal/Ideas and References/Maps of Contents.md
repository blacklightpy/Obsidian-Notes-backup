* What are Maps of Contents (MoC)?

Maps of Contents are notes that show the interconnections of notes. They are meta-notes. MoCs can be generated for topics and areas of interests, etc. Multiple MoCs can link to the same note.

For analogy, if links and backlinks are roads, tags are road signs and folders are houses, MoCs are maps.
