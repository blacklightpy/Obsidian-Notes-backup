**Screen utilization**
Horizontally separated content (A | B | C) saves a lot of screen space in comparison to using bullet points, that too without disregarding whitespaces.

**Folders**
Folders are like boxes. Too many or too less folders and it becomes harder to find data. This means folders must be created in proportion to the notes.

But then as the number of notes increase, the organizational structure of folders itself should change. Since folders represent categorization, and not just unnamed shelves.

A system that always does this upon addition of new information could be define to be in a state of perfect sort. But for quick recall, we'll have to memorize the categorizations each time, and that is infeasible for a structure that's constantly changing.

- Files in a folder, aside from just notes here, can be of different types. That too matters when it comes to making new folders.
- Don't go too hard on organizing. Have fun with it. Otherwise no one would've come up with new methods.

**Use numbering like MIT Courses**
- e.g. [60.01] Topic A, [60.02] Topic B, etc. with predefined category numbers
