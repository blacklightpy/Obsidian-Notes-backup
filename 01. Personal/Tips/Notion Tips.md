Q. How to sync databases partially across workspaces?

<u>Ans:-</u>

You can't sync databases partially in Notion. But, you can do this.
Create a master database and link all databases to it.

Otherwise, you can also use Notion2Sheets to sync to Google Sheets and hide the columns from Google Sheets.
