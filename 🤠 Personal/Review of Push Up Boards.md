Well, if you're gonna use them, you're gonna need a manual on how to place your hand, what posture to take and how to move your body. And some of these exercises are not even understood, unless you know what the maker of the board intended. It's like the saying that goes in singing classes, "it is better to not know how to sing, than to know the wrong way of doing it".

Of course, to fuck around and find out is one way of finding new ideas, and that's exactly how we developed our notions of music. However, when it comes to exercises, unlike with music, doing bad exercises will have a damaging effect on your body. So it is best to always stick to what others have found over the years in this case. That is not to say that exercises are all wrong because someone had to make damages to their body so that others can learn from it. Someone who makes a mistake does not make all mistakes at once. One or the other mistakes would be understood and tabulated over the years to form our understanding of the right methods, just like any other branch of science.

So, one should review the function of a push up board by comparing the exercises that are supposed to be done with them. Nevertheless, it is better to buy a Calisthenics Push Up Bar that can be moved according to your needs.
