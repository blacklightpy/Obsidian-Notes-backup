A cellular automaton is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory.

It has found application in various areas, including [[physics]], [[biology]] and [[microstructure]] modelling.

# History and Popular Applications
- First discovered by Stainslaw Ulam and John von Neumann at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
- [[Conway's Game of Life]] popularized it
- Stephen Wolfram's [[Wolfram Physics]]
- Simulation of physical processes on the Connection Machine, Richard Feynman, Stephen Wolfram, etc. ([[Feynman's Theory of Cellular Automata]])
