Or more generally, the electromagnetic current propagation model of quantum mechanics.

That is, current flows because a source of with a given strong potential attracts charged particles towards itself. Of course, if it attracts one kind of charged particles, it repels the oppositely charged particles.

This is why low voltage cells need a solid conducting material to push or pull their free electrons easily in order to complete the circuit.

But in high voltage cells, they have enough power to attract or repel whole particles containing charges from their surroundings, pulling them through the free space.

Ugh, why do they ask "what does the single electron interfere with"? What proof do they have that there was only a single electron? Did they not only have proof for the fact that they only observed one point on the fluorescent screen?

That single point could very well have been the only particle that finally had enough momentum to hit the screen, out of all the particles that were radiated outward.

That is, either by this "lightning model" or by the "shooting balls" model, or by the "wave" model (all of which, being ways in which we can model fluid flows, give the possibility for a single point having a higher amplitude relative to all other points, and this point could just be the point that we observe on the screen), we are able to describe a single spot on the fluorescent screen.
