# Energy
$E = hf$

But $E \: \alpha \: A^2f^2$ 

This is because:
- Photoelectric effect has a linear dependence
- Light has wave-like and particle-like properties, so $f^2$ is not best suited
- It just be different, the way it is quantized as $E=hf$ 

# Intensity
Also $I \: \alpha \: n$

But $I \: \alpha \: A^2$

This is because:
- Its quantized bro
- You could say $A \: \alpha \: \sqrt{n}$
