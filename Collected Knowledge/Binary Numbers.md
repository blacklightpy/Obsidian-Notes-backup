This is a draft page.

I gave this it's own note because it is very common, and I usually have to explain it to people. This actually should just be "number systems".

But people don't really have to know all there is about binary numbers in that context, so I'll still have to make a separate explanation, but I can list the main page as a further reference. Maybe I'll just link to "number systems".

Anyways, once that is done, I'll remove this content from here. This idea will be in [[Thinking About How to Convery Information]].
