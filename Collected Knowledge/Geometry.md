Geometry is a branch of [[Mathematics]] concerned with the properties of space such as the distance, shape, size and relative position of figures.

Until 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to [[Euclidean Geometry]], which includes the notions of [[Point]], [[Line]], [[Plane]], [[Distance]], [[Angle]], [[Surface]] and [[Curve]] as fundamental concepts.
