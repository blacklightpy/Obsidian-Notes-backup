## Idea 1: GNU OS based on the Linux OS
GNU was an OS project choosing to emulate Unix, without a specific hardware goal.
Linux was an OS project focused on running itself on the Intel 80386 processor.

GNU started in 1983, and Linux started in 1991, 

## Idea 2: Linux based GNU systems
GNU is a Unix inspired free OS that is almost completely distributed with the Linux kernel.
While the GNU project chose to 

## Idea 3: 

Blacklight OS is a free POSIX-compliant OS distribution running atop Linux.
The first such POSIX-compliant OS was GNU, and Blacklight OS is proudly following in its footsteps.

Blacklight OS is a distribution containing the following parts:

- Ice Cream Theory C Library
- Toybox System Utilities

Blacklight OS depends on the following free software:
- FreeBSD Operating System (For its C Library)
- Toybox (For its System Utilities)
## Idea 4: Like Windows
Early versions of Windows shipped the POSIX subsystem, which was alongside the Win32 subsystem, the OS/2 subsystem and the security subsystem (Access Control).

So, NT could implement both the POSIX OS and the Win32 OS. But it has removed the POSIX subsystem since Windows XP.

So, Win32/NT, POSIX/NT, GNU/Linux.
GNU/Linux would simply be POSIX/Linux.

POSIX/Linux could be called *chuckles* Lunix.
Ubuntu would be a Lunix distribution.
