Poetry is an arrangement of words, and the aim of poetry is to convey an emotion about an entity. The emotion can only be invoked by the specific arrangement of words, and therefore the beauty of poetry lies not in the idea conveyed, but in the flow of words itself. Poetry relies on the phonetics and combinations of words.

In contrast, science uses words to convey a result. Here, the idea is of prime importance, and the specific words used to convey the idea do not matter.
