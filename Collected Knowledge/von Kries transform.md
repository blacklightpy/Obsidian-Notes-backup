The von Kries chromatic adaptaton method is a technique that is sometimes used in camera image processing. The method is to apply a gain to each of the human cone cell spectral sensitivity responses so as to keep the adapted appearance of the reference white constant.

von Kries transform is defined for the [[LMS Colour Space]].
The more complete von Kries transform, used for colours in the [[CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space|XYZ]] or [[RGB Colour Spaces|RGB]] colour spaces includes matrix transformations into and out of the [[LMS Colour Space|LMS space]].
