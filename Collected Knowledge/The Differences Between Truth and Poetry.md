# Truth vs Poetry
- Beautiful words are just.. beautiful. They are not true.
- Poetry is made by making garlands out of words.
- It is not concerned with expressing the truth
- The truth doesn't often lend itself to being expressed in beautiful combinations of words
- It is still possible, in some cases, by careful consideration of words - but not for all cases
- It depends on how well the language's vocabulary is compatible with beautifully expressing the idea
- In any case, poetry is more concerned with its beauty than the truth

In other words, in most cases, a poem is a beautiful lie.

It may also be simply meaningless, after all, it's just a beautiful combination of words.
# Nature of Poetry
- Next, poetry is descriptive, and is meant to be interpreted
- The interpretation of poems go beyond their literal words, and takes the reader's mind into a flow of imagination
