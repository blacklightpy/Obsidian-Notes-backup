I'm assuming Linux kernel.

Pull the kernel and build one.
Try building a kernel for Raspberry Pi from upstream instructions.
Get a small i2c device and check out its driver source code.
Make a small i2c driver if necessary.

Check out the kernel logs for the boot up sequence on the Raspberry Pi up to the userspace.
