This is based on the Jihaad law:
- And fight them until there is no fitnah and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah. And if they cease - then indeed, Allah is Seeing of what they do. (8:39)
	- Hadeeth 4560 says this is because of how Muslims were persecuted when they were minority, so the way to fix all Muslim problems is to fight all polytheists.
- 9:5, etc.

- Kitman
	- As a form of Taqiyya (Jihaad al-Talab)
	- Saheeh Muslim 2605a
		- Humaid b. 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Auf reported that his mother Umm Kulthum daughter of 'Uqba b. Abu Mu'ait, and she was one amongst the first emigrants who pledged allegiance to Allah's Apostle (ﷺ), as saying that she heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying:
		  
		  A liar is not one who tries to bring reconciliation amongst people and speaks good (in order to avert dispute), or he conveys good. Ibn Shihab said he did not hear that exemption was granted in anything what the people speak as lie but in **three cases: in war, for bringing reconciliation amongst persons and the narration of the words of the husband to his wife, and the narration of the words of a wife to her husband.**
- Tawriyya
	- As a form of Taqiyya (Jihaad al-Talab)
	- Source
		- It is absolutely forbidden to tell a lie and to say that something happened though it did not happen. The permission in the hadith about lying is in the form of “tawriya” and “iham”.
		- **Tawriya** means a person’s using a word that has several meanings, by referring to its least used meaning.
		- **Iham** means using a word that has two meanings by referring to its meaning that is used less.
	- Examples
		- We can give the following examples to explain them:
			- When you say to the enemy soldier, “Your king died” during a war, you can mean one of the previous kings of the enemy.
			- When it is necessary to speak and express an opinion but you do not want Islam and Muslims to be harmed, you can make some indirect sentences without resorting to direct lies.
			- Similarly, if a person who wants to win the hearts of his wife and daughter uses an expression such as “InshaAllah - if Allah wills” when he promises them something and does not immediately give them what he has promised, he will not be regarded to have lied because this promise is related to the future.
- Muruna
	- It's about not being too strict
	- "Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship" (Qur'an 2:185)
	- "So fear Allah as much as you are able" (Qur'an 64:16)
	- It's a positive thing, but it helps one blend in.
- Taqiyya
	- Etymology
		- In the verse 3:28, there is a word that was written in the Uthmani script as تقىة. Most versions (like Hafs and Warsh) read it as تقاة (_tuqaat_), however one version (by Ya'qub al-Yamani) uses the word taqiya (تقية):
	- Outright Lying
		- A poet, Kab bin al-Ashruf, had offended Muhammad by making derogatory verse about Muslim women. Muhammad exclaimed in front of his followers: "Who will kill this man who has hurt Allah and his prophet?" A young Muslim named Muhammad bin Maslama volunteered, but with the caveat that, in order to get close enough to Kab to assassinate him, he be allowed to lie to the poet. Muhammad agreed. Maslama traveled to Kab and began denigrating Islam and Muhammad, carrying on this way till his disaffection became convincing enough for Kab to take him into his confidences. Soon thereafter, Maslama appeared with another Muslim and, while Kab's guard was down, they assaulted and killed him. They ran to Muhammad with Kab's head, to which the latter cried: "Allahu akbar" or "God is great" (see the hadith accounts of Sahih Bukhari and Ibn Sad).
	- Claims that it is only against threats
		- Qur'an 3:28
			- "The Muslims must not befriend the disbelievers, in preference over the Muslims; whoever does that has no connection whatsoever with Allah, except if you fear them; Allah warns you of His wrath; and towards Allah only is the return."
		- Tafseer ibn Katheer 3:28
			- "... (unless you indeed fear a danger from them) meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly. For instance, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Ad-Darda' said, "We smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them.'' Al-Bukhari said that Al-Hasan said, "The Tuqyah is allowed until the Day of Resurrection.'' ..."
		- Tafseer al-Tabar 3:28 (to verify)
			- "If you [Muslims] are under their [infidels'] authority, fearing for yourselves, behave loyally to them, with your tongue, while harbouring inner animosity for them... Allah has forbidden believers from being friendly or on intimate terms with the infidels in place of believers – except when infidels are above them [in authority]. In such a scenario, let them act friendly towards them."
		- Qur'an 16:106
- ~~Hiyal~~
	- I believe this is actually forbidden in Islaam, according to most sources.
	- Disobey rulers on matters where they go against God (Qur'an 4:29)
		- Saheeh Muslims 1844a
	- Hiding his faith in front of Pharaoh (Qur'an 40:28)
- ~~Darura~~
	- It is a positive thing that lets people do Haram out of necessity
	- Like eating Pork (2:173 and 5:3)
	- Avoiding fast if sick (2:185)
	- There is no difficulty (22.78)

>The technical meaning of the term _taqiyya_ is thought [_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] to be derived from the [Quranic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") reference to religious dissimulation in [Sura 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sura_3 "Sura 3"):28:

Muhammad is quoted in the Hadith saying: "If I take an oath and later find something else better, I do what is better and break my oath (see Sahih Bukhari V7B67N427)."


 
 The entire sequence of Quranic revelations are a testimony to taqiyya and, since Allah is believed to be the revealer of these verses, he ultimately is seen as the perpetrator of deceit. This is not surprising since Allah himself is often described in the Quran as the "best deceiver" or "schemer." (see 3:54, 8:30, 10:21).
 
 This phenomenon revolves around the fact that the Quran contains both peaceful and tolerant verses, as well as violent and intolerant ones. When Muslims are weak, they should preach and behave according to the Meccan verses; when strong, they should go on the offensive, according to the Medinan verses.
 
 Many Islamic books extensively deal with the doctrine of abrogation, or Al-Nasikh Wa Al-Mansukh. according to all four recognised schools of Sunni jurisprudence, war against the infidel goes on in perpetuity, until "all chaos ceases, and all religion belongs to Allah" (Quran 8:39).
 
 According to the definitive Encyclopaedia of Islam (Brill Online edition): "The duty of the jihad exists as long as the universal domination of Islam has not been attained. Peace with non-Muslim nations is, therefore, a provisional state of affairs only; the chance of circumstances alone can justify it temporarily. Furthermore there can be no question of genuine peace treaties with these nations; only truces, whose duration ought not, in principle, to exceed ten years, are authorised. But even such truces are precarious, inasmuch as they can, before they expire, be repudiated unilaterally should it appear more profitable for Islam to resume the conflict."
 
 Islam's dichotomised worldview pits Dar al Islam (House of Islam) against Dar al Harb (House of War or non-Muslims) until the former subsumes the latter. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Szj_OlhU6_E&t=3161s and https://www.meforum.org/2095/islams-doctrines-of-deception)
