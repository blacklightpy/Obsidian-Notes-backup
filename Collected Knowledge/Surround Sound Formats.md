Surround Sound Formats are digital audio playback formats that contain information for [[Surround Sound Systems]].

# Dolby Atmos
It is the most popular surround sound format used in home theatres. In addition, most streaming services support Dolby Atmos. It supports up to 24 floor speakers and up to 10 overhead speakers, which allows to have any object-based surround system that you can have inside your home.

A downside with it is that it requires you to have at least one overhead speaker. This can be solved by adding an extra overhead speaker to your 5.1 or 7.1 setup.

# Dolby Digital
It supports all the popular legacy formats such as 5.1 and 7.1.

# DTS and DTS:X
It can support up to 32 speaker locations and up to an 11.2 surround sound system. It also supports legacy configurations such as 5.1 and 7.1. Streaming services currently do not provide DTS, so it is limited to Blu-ray or DVD.
