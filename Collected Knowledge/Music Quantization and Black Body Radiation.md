# Topic
- Music is quantized in beats
- Fourier Transform can transform any structure (like a song or a continuous painting) into a single equation (set of frequencies at an amplitude / a set of cycles at a radius giving strokes)
- The key idea would be to represent silences as low amplitude waves and discontinuities in paintings as thin unnoticeable strokes.
- Also, since it is like $a_1e^{2 \pi x_1} + a_2e^{2 \pi x_2} + ..$ (or something like it), the order doesn't seem to matter either, making it simply a linear combination or composition (like layering of sounds, but each track for the whole length).
- That would also mean the resultant track is a single complete cycle of the whole composite wave.

So, does that mean, since a black body absorbs and emits all frequencies, each frequency may have a characteristic amplitude?

So that defines the electromagnetic sound of the black body?

Could that also be the colour of the black body?
(Related term "absorbance"?)

Also on another note, could colour simply be the electromagnetic version of sound? Hmm.
