- Stress / strain due to intermolecular forces
- Viscosity due to intermolecular forces
- Pressure due to intermolecular forces
- Density due to intermolecular forces
- Buoyancy due to pressure and density

- How do viscosity and density arise from intermolecular forces?
	- Why can't viscosity be described in terms of density?
