Infructescence (fruiting head) is defined as the ensemble of [[Fruits]] derived from the [[Ovaries]] of an [[Inflorescence]]. It usually retains the size and structure of the inflorescence.

In some cases, the infructescences are similar in appearance to simple fruits. These are called [[Multiple Fruits]].
