Filter Graphs in multimedia processing are directed graphs. The edges represent one-way transfer of data and the nodes represent [[Filters]]. The edges are called pipes, and they are part of the [[Pipe and Filter Architecture]].

Filters are functional blocks that do a specific activity in the multimedia processing workflow.

For example, DirectShow is based on the Component Object Model (COM) architecture, where filters are COM objects.
