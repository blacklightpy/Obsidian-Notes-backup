- We must remember that we first designed tools without an abstract interface, even for something as simple as a water spray bottle. At first, we had to collect the water in a mug and pour water, but later, we developed spray cans, where it becomes easier for the user to simply press a button, and have the mechanical system output the right amount of spray. This isn't automated, as compared to a clockwork automaton, however, it paints the right picture.
- The computer looks at the command, and analyzes the "intent", "subject" and "parameters".
- Of course, this is not infallible, but through repeated trial and error, we can arrive at a standard way of parsing the intended instruction. Still, communication errors must not occur during critical events, so a standard means of communication can be established with a limited range of valid syntax.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that I said we can establish an infallible communication link by establishing a limited method of communication. However, this is only achieved by removing the freedom for the sake of clarity. Freedom itself remains important whenever clarity is not critical. Also, this approach turns the system into less of an intelligent system, and more of a machine.

> This is not a good model for humanity to follow on a regular basis. Simply because it kills free will of a being whose sole differentiating factor is their free will.

- In this manner, we turn the computer into less of a tool, but more of a resourceful friend, like Vision from Avengers.
- An AI turning into Ultron is simply a manifestation of human fears, as far as I'm concerned. An AI will have enough data and logical processing power to know how to and why it must do good, because I can see it for myself.
