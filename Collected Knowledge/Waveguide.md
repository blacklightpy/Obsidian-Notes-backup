A waveguide is used to direct a wave along a specific path. But waves emitted from a body falls off as it spreads out in all directions by the inverse of the area of the sphere intersecting the point originating at the source. So a wave needs amplification to keep flowing.

Aside from the amplifiers used in discrete points in telecommunications, the medium itself serves as an amplifier to counteract the attenuation of the fields
# Types
- Acoustic Waveguides
	- Tin Can Telephone
- RF Waveguides
- Optical Waveguides
	- Optical Fibre
- Transmission Lines
	- Long lines need to take wave nature into account
	- In the past, the [[Transatlantic Submarine Telecommunication Cables|submarine telegraph cables]] faced interference, for which the [[Telegrapher's equations|theory of tranmission lines]] had to be devised.
	- In the present, submarine telecommunication cables are made of optical fibers, so the data is completely free of any interference.
# Features
- Mode Profile
- Dispersion

We have to ask two questions about the waveguide to see how the signal will appear at the receiving end.

A waveguide can be treated as a Linear System, whose [[Collected Knowledge/Transfer Function]] we have to find, alongside the "shape" of the wave within the waveguide -- for any arbitrary frequency -- to see if a given signal will arrive in phase or frequency at the receiving end.
