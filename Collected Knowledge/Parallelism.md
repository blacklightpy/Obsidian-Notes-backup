Parallelism is a property of [[Affine Geometry|affine geometries]] and [[Euclidean Geometry]] is a special instance of such a geometry.

The simplest case that defines parallelism is that of [[Parallel Lines]], which is the subject of study of Euclid's 5th postulate (parallel postulate).

Parallel lines are coplanar infinite straight [[Line|lines]] that do not [[Intersection|intersect]] at any point. If two lines are non-coplanar, then they are [[Skew Lines]].

[[Parallel Curves]] are identical [[Curve|curves]] that curves that do not intersect or touch each other tangentially and keep a fixed minimum distance.
