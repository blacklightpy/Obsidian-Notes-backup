- When you write something, you usually use your hand and ink.
- Even using a pen automates the flow of the ink by the shape of the container and the nib, as opposed to writing with a feather, or by hand-painting.

- When typing on a phone or with a keyboard, the press of a control point generates a glyph on the presenter device, digitally.
- The glyph is a representation of the data, so a press from you generated an ASCII character, which was displayed as a glyph. So by your hand, you stored signals onto the digital storage.
- But when code is automated, the press of a single button sets a lot of things into action, and a binary is generated. This is like using an electric car.
- Using a complex program also performs a similar role, and most of the times, the user doesn't really understand what's going on under the hood. I believe that's a necessity for anything that humans have built, because we are beings who like to understand things, and at least we must understand what we built as a species.

- For that reason, I like to build systems myself, so that at least it's documented enough for all the users, which is most often just me.
