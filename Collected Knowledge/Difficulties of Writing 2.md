Same as [[Difficulties of Writing 1 - Representing the Diverse Flow of Thought]]

Say I want to explain three ideas. First I list the three ideas. Then, it is tempting to want to explain the last idea first.

Also, by the time you start describing the ideas one by one, you'd have broken the original flow of thought. That is, right when you say "I'll start with the first point".
## Possible Fix
Skip saying "I'll start with the first point", and say "If you consider the "contents of first point"". This way, you do not assign a number to the points. But still, stick to the same linear format, as that is better in the long run.
