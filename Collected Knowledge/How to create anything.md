First, we must have a vision. I'm not yet talking about whether it should be big or small. But there should be a vision, nevertheless.

Then, we must find a way to create it from the ideas we already know. I know that's simple to say, but I'm not finished yet, I'll expand on it.

So, if our current understanding does not let us create it, we will have to refine our understanding itself. The field of endeavour that seeks such an understanding is called science, and when our knowledge is classified, it becomes part of a scientific discipline.

But I'll focus more on creating something from the ideas that we already know of.
# The main problem
So we now know that we have to have a vision and also eventually build it, or manifest it into the concrete world.

But where do we start from? Do we start from the vision and try to fit it into the world, or do we start from the basic components, and hope for the path we take to lead to the vision?

Colloquially, this is known as the problem of looking at the trees vs the forest. A good architect, although he may have a preference, must eventually come to do both.

Starting from the basic blocks is known as the **bottom-up** approach. Starting from the vision and filling in the details is known as the **top-down** approach.

- Jyothish, raise the bar for tolerance
	- A Java implementation can be inefficient relative to a C++ implementation
		- But a poor C++ implementation will be outperformed by a good Java implementation
	- However, having a Java implementation is better than not having a implementation
	- So let us first tolerate weak implementations to foster ideas, then optimize it
	
	- This optimization should not be done in such a way that the resulting program will end up being less customizable. That is, instead of converting a Lua program to C++, make a compiler that would efficiently convert the Lua implementation to C++. Also (I'm only using Lua as an example here), make sure that Lua is designed to provide a specific format of design workflow, by which you will always end up designing good programs.

1. Story of the White bird.
	1. In a world the scientists figured out that when you are in the grace of god, a white bird will appear
	2. So people started looking for the white bird, and they started to capture them
