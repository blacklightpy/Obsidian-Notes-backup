## In philosophy
The distinction between [[Subject]] and [[Object]] is a basic idea of philosophy.

- A subject is a being that exercises agency, undergoes conscious experiences, is situated in relation to other things that exist outside itself
	- Thus, a subject is any individual, person, or observer
- An object is any of the things observed or experienced by a subject, which may even include other beings
	- Thus, from their own points of view: other subjects
