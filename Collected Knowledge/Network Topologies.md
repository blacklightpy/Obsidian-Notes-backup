- Point to Point (Achieved via direct connection)
- Bus (Achieved via network addressing)
	- This topology is similar to the spinal cord
- Ring (Achieved via network addressing in combination with transceivers on each device)
	- Achieved by Daisy Chaining
	- Linear Daisy chaining is also similar, but each computer requires two receivers and transmitters (for two directions)
- Star (Achieved via direct connection to a central node)
- Tree (Achieved via hierarchical connections, which can also be seen as chaining stars)
- Mesh (Achieved via direct connections between multiple nodes)
- Hybrid (Combination of any of the other networks)
# Centralization
- Star Topology is centralized
- Tree topology is a hierarchical connection of Star topologies
# Decentralization
- Mesh topology is decentralized.
	- A limited hop mesh topology has a hypercube topology
		- This is similar to how in grid networks (e.g. Electrical), a linear or ring topology is used.
		- Multidimensional rings have a toroidal topology (remember the 3 houses and 3 supplies problem?)
	- Military networks use Point to Point connections between all nodes to get maximum reliability.
