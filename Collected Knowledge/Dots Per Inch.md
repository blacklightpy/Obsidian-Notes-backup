- Horizontal and Vertical DPI isn't the same
- DPI requires knowing the screen size and the resolution
- But one can scale around by adjusting DPI without knowing what the natural DPI is

- Screen DPI is different from the System DPI, which is what we are usually interested in

- Even if EDID (see [[Adjusting Monitor Brightness in Linux]]) helps in knowing the physical dimensions, this does not work for a projector (see [[Colour Systems]]).
