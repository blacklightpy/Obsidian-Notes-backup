Also known as Carbon Dating or C-14 Dating or Radiocarbon Dating.

## Premise
- Particles, Molecules, Atoms, Isotopes, Nuclear Stability and Radiation
	- #rough (Study of Particles, from a child's POV)
		- What makes things different?
		- Things seem to be different, yet some things that seem unique are combinations of other things
		- Are all things that seem unique really combinations of other things too?

- Principle of Half-Life (Radioactive elements undergo a process of decay in a logarithmic scale, halving in amount every N years)
- Half-Life of C-14:
- Atmospheric C-12 (Stable) to C-14
