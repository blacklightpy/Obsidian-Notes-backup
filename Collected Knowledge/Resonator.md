A resonator is a device or system that exhibits [[Resonance]] or resonant behaviour.

The oscillations in a resonator can either be electromagnetic or mechanical.

Resonators are used to either generate waves of specific frequencies or to select specific frequencies from a signal. Musical instruments use acoustic resonators to produce sound waves of specific tones.

A common example is [[Quartz]] used in RF transmitters and quartz watches to produce oscillations of very precise frequencies.
