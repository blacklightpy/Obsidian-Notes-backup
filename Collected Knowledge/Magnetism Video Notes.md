Electromagnets always need a battery to 
A chemical reaction.

i.e. the battery is part of the circuit.

Charged particles alone won't cause magnetic effects, or even move, because it only moves when
it is pushed. I'm talking about the initial motion of the universe.

Of course it will get pushed if they are put in a certain position, by god.
In a special way that the protons and electrons were not close enough to cancel out.
(I'm aware they didn't form until after the quarks)

But what's more likely is that he set in a battery to move the charged particles.
A potential well from the collection of charges, causing a reaction.
And thus flow of particles.

i.e. Big Bang is not a bang, but a Redox Reaction.

But possibly one where god recharges the battery.
So the 

And there's always a circuit

And we have to just choose the circuit.
No, you have no way from choosing the circuit
You are part of the circuit, you can't do it any other way.

The nature of the circuit would be more than like a simple electronic circuit though.
The same circuit is what caused the gluons, quarks, neutrinos and electrons to form
before the protons and the atoms. The same circuit bound the energy into particles
and then made particles flow.

When I was making this, one of my imaginary students asked me a question.


So, if it's just an electron, why is the field still there on one side after
the electron moved to the other side


So I said, that's because it's just a photograph showing how the field will be
when it reaches that point. Or think of it as a current, so 



Wait a minute, is that all that different?


It's really like a stone moving through water.
Or like a fucking comet entering the air.



mc = E/c (c = distance/time, just space and time dimension conversions)

m x/t = ma x / (x/t)
m x/t = m(x/t^2) x / (x/t)
m x/t = m (x^2/t*2) / (x/t)

So if I just replace Maxwell's laws

Will anyone have an objection?

Whirlpool mode

Like water is being sucked in, if a positive charge moves to left, or negative charge moves right (when looking from behind). (right hand thumb rule)

EXPERIMENT

If I rotate this stick, won't I get a radiation outward?
If I rotate this forwards and backwards, won't I get a wave-like radiation outward?

Water molecules but 

Like a ball moving forward among other balls

Like it has a life of it's own

But it's not same as the balls (well it is more like a comet)

It is bound here..

But the binding is from the same field though..

What's an analogy for that?

Hmm - 

A string bound, flowing among other strings? (Isn't this like string theory?)

But that doesn't explain charges though.

It's almost like the fields are bound in a way that they are connected

And opposite connections attract while like ones repel.

So it's like creating a charge creates the anti charge too.

But it's not protons vs electrons, but positrons vs electrons.

Well, if one particle is bigger than the others, of course it will move slowly

while the smaller ones jiggle harder (Brownian motion, different particle sizes)

And electron shells are like the same projections I saw in Steve Mould's video?
("Everyone should see this experiment for themselves")

Electrons should jiggle due to their repulsions and attractions

Then, how does a wave of light excite them to another state?

Btw why do neutrons bind with protons?

Also why do they take a specific shape of orbitals even?
(Vibrations, spherical harmonics?)

Also why do Hydrogen's electrons don't fall into the proton?

Of course energy levels, but why?

Because electrons are basically clouds, made of smaller particles?

(Lmao Duotrons from Star Trek)
