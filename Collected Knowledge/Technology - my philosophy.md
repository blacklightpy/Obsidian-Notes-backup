The word technology literally means the study of techniques. In a deeper sense, it is the study of the principles of art and craft.

The word originates from a Greek word, τεχνολογία (tekhnología) which means the "systematic treatment of grammar".

It further derives from the word τεχνολόγος (tekhnológos) which means "treating by the rules of art".

It is a combination of the words τέχνη (tékhnē) + -λόγος (-lógos) which means art and -logist restepectively.

λόγος (-lógos) further derives from the word λέγω (légō) which means "to put in order".

## Modern day definition
So technology by itself in the modern world means the methods as well as devices created out of such methods, which organize the wonders of nature. This while in itself is just a form of "art", by adding our intentions to such a device or method, we can make it "useful".
