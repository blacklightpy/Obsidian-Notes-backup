It was the first non-Abelian [[Gauge Theory]] which was helpful in creating the [[Quantum Field Theory]] for [[Weak Interactions]] which helped in forming the [[Standard Model]].

Non-Abelian gauge theories also produced what's called "asymptotic freedom", which was believed to be an important aspect of [[Strong Interactions]]. Soon this was used to form [[Quantum Chromodynamics|QCD]].

The Standard Model unifies electromagnetism, weak forces and strong forces under the language of gauge theory.
