The EM field tensor is a stress-energy tensor.

From Wikipedia:
> The **stress–energy tensor**, sometimes called the **stress–energy–momentum tensor** or the **energy–momentum tensor**, is a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor") [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity") that describes the [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density") and [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux "Flux") of [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") and [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") in [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), generalizing the [stress tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor "Cauchy stress tensor") of [Newtonian physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_physics "Newtonian physics"). It is an attribute of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"), [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation "Radiation"), and non-gravitational [force fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(physics) "Force field (physics)"). This density and flux of energy and momentum are the sources of the [gravitational field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field") in the [Einstein field equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations "Einstein field equations") of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"), just as mass density is the source of such a field in [Newtonian gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_gravity "Newtonian gravity").


It is used in relativistic physics, but it can be quantized by a [[Lagrangian Mechanics|Lagrangian]] formulation.
# Doubt clearance
- The electron field, also known as the electron-positron field, is a matter field, whose quanta are the electron and positron.
- The electric field, also known as the electromagnetic field, is a force field, whose quanta are the photons.

- All particles are excitations of their own particle-antiparticle field.
- Charged particles such as quarks, electrons, muons and taus, and their antiparticles interact via the electromagnetic field.
- For example, electrons and positrons are affected by the electromagnetic field, but neutrinos aren't.
- Quarks are disturbances in the [[Quarks|quark]] field, and they interact via the [[Gluons|gluon]] field.
