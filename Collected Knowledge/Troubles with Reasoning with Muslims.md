From a Redditor:
> - Take out the Qur'an and they'll complain it's out of context.  
> - Take out the context from an islamic teacher they'll complain they're just a nobody.  
> - Take out the hadeeth since it's not quoted from a nobody and they'll still complain it's not trustworthy.  
> - Take out an Fiqh book that has been signed by Al-Azhar and they'll complain that it's not the Qur'an.
