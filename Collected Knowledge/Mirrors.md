Mirrors are highly polished surfaces. In surface finishing, mirrors finish is the most polished finishing.

That's because mirrors don't have many protruding surfaces that reflect light away, and hence most light is reflected towards the normal.

Glasses are used in front of mirrors to protect the reflective surface from scratches.
