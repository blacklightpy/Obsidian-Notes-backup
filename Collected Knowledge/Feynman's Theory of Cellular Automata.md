According to the designer of the Connection Machine:

- Feynman cited the Game of Life as an example of [[Cellular Automaton|cellular automata]].
- He wondered what was at the smallest level of the universe.
- One possible answer was that it was a cellular automaton.
- The notion is that, at the lowest level, the "continuum" might be discrete in both space and time, and the laws of physics might be a macroscopic result of the behaviour of those tiny cells.
- Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbours, like the lattice calculation for Lattice QCD.
- If the universe in fact worked this way, it would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space.
