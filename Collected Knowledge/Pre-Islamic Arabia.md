> I think the society was far progressive than what happened later. Muhammadâ€™s wife Khadijah was a rich businesswoman who hired Muhammad. This shows the society was far more progressive before oppressive Muhammad took over. Khadijah married Muhammad who was a poor worker which again shows the progressiveness of the society where a rich woman marries a poor servant man.
