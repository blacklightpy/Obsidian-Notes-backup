- Force = Energy/distance.
- Power = Energy/time.
- A lever is used to trasmit energy applied over a longer distance to a shorter distance, in the same time, increasing the force applied at one end. This is the same as preservation of [[Torque|torque]].
- A gear functions like a lever, but it has multiple points of contact which help it to continuously transmit the torque to another gear, or a chain of gears in full rotations.
