The current method used is to convert words to an extinct language like Latin or Greek.

However, I think this makes things difficult, in the same manner as concepts in Sanskrit are hard to read.

Thus, I prefer to convert them back to a common language, while at the same time, producing a method to translate it into another language while preserving proper [[Orthography]] (ahem, correct writing techniques).
