We tend to think of motion in terms of position and its first few derivatives - velocity and acceleration. Rarely do we ever get to [[jerk]].

But if we think about it, we only approximate them by looking at the scale of classical mechanics.

In [[Quantum Mechanics]], the concept of position itself is not static enough for us to take derivatives of it across time.
