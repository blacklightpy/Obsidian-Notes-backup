Ariana Grande will always say she can manifest her own reality.
But why is it always that their reality is limited to one where they are on top of the world?
Why can't they have a reality where everyone has the same experience?
What this points to is that, their idea of manifestation is simply one that comes from greedy desires.
And with such an idea, they can ignore real moral responsibilities and focus on themselves.

In a certain sense, manifestation is also compatible with Christianity.
Both are ideas wherein this world is virtual, and something we need to escape from.
The only difference is that in Christianity, god blesses us, and in manifestation, we choose to do it ourselves.

Again, this is the definition of greed, to wish for more than that's possible.
The reason greed is wrong, is because this world simply is a state of coexistence.
That is, what they want is a world designed for them, but in such a world, others wouldn't have free will.
So what they are dreaming for is a world without other people.
Because the real problem is that they cannot tolerate existing with other people with varied beliefs.

Manifestation isn't possible.
What is possible is having a strong mindset and working towards it.
Also know as, having a vision and working in line with it.
The idea of manifestation fits that principle, but the point is, any other definition does not.
# Christians
Christians believe god is good, but nothing else is good, and that we are all sinners.
Christians would make babies and say, you're here because of my sin, and you will be saved if you believe in God.
They will have no remorse in doing so, because they are sinners by nature, and they are forgiven.
Their love for anyone else is secondary to their god who saves them.

This is against the ways of our senses, by which we make our daily decisions.
If anything, it was these senses that the creator of the world gave us.
And it is these very senses by which those who are raised Christian accepted their religion.

That is, because they found it relatable, just like how anyone believes anything.
However, we must also know that a child raised in the IS would believe that all of you are sinners too.
What this points out is not that some of you are rightly guided, but others are evil born.

If that was the case, you would not even be able to trust your neighbor.
Then you would decide that anyone, who when presented the message of Christ, trusts it, is trustworthy.
But then that wouldn't be so different from how Muslims present their religion, and consider nonbelievers as evil.
Then you would say that it is a test of truth, where the good ones are designed to trust the message of Christ.

What you are missing here is that people trust concepts based on their experiences in life.
Anyone who refuses to touch the fire purely and only because his parents said so, is respectful, but foolish.
The reason a person should not touch fire should either be from prior experience, or from sound reasoning.

# Islam

They think that the world is full of horrors.

This is how they think:

- Pre-marital sex is evil and horrific, in Islam.
- Getting thrown into fires and explosions is evil and horrific (unless God does it), in Islam.

- Pre-martial sex is not evil for a normal person, outside of any indoctrination (what is evil is rape and murder).
- Getting thrown into fires and explosions is evil and horrific (regardless of whoever does it). (Sometimes evil combats evil, but that doesn't make the evil that combats evil any less evil, it only makes it rational)

So, Muslims first adopt Islam, and they confuse getting thrown into fires and explosions by the society with pre-marital sex, as both are evil, and there's no degree of difference between them.

Actually there is, where Shirk, or disbelief is the highest sin. That is followed by murder (outside of Sharia, or Islamic ruling). And thirdly, Zina or forbidden sexual relationships. These three are the greatest of sins, and there are further major sins, which include listening to music, fleeing from Jihad, or holy war, theft, etc.

Because they've placed Murder as one of the highest since to fit the society, yet placed it less harmful that Shirk, people would think less of murder than they would otherwise. And placing Zina just below murder, again, to fit the social understanding of murder, while pulling on the social status of sexual affairs, made it more comparable to murder than to a lesser sin. Sins lesser in comparison to Zina include robbery, fleeing from Jihad, or religious war, etc. By placing Zina as worse than robbery, the punishment for Zina would be more harmful than fleeing for one's life (which would yet again be because of the greatest sin, Shirk, or disbelief), robbery, etc.

What this shows is not that Islam has respect for upkeeping social peace, but ensuring that anyone who questions faults with their version of peace will be harmed, so that Islamic idea of peace will never fall. While this is supposedly done to keep peace, what it does upkeep is insecurity and control.
