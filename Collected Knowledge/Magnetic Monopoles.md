They have not been observed. They were predicted by Dirac and many [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]] models.

- Dirac proposed magnetic monopoles which would simplify the model of electromagnetism. Dirac monopoles would not fit into the standard model, and would require modifications.
- In GUT theories, early universe would've produced magnetic monopoles. But it is hard to reproduce, and [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] energies are too low for them.
# Studies
- [Nature Materials Article (Open Access)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3905) (2014): Discovery of magnetic monopole quasi-particles in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. They do violate the zero-divergence law.
- [HN Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38550994) | [Nature Materials Article (Open Access)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01737-4) (Dec 2023): Discovery of magnetic monopole quasi-particles, which are multiple particles whose combined spin effects generate a monopole on a 2D cross-section. Not a big deal fundamentally. But could be in line with my idea of making magnetic monopoles manually.
# Implications
Their existence would imply:
- Maxwell's equations would clean up
	- $\nabla \cdot \vec E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$
	- $\nabla \cdot \vec B = \mu_0 \rho_m$
	- $\nabla \times \vec B = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \mu_0 J_e$
	- $\nabla \times \vec E = \frac{-\partial B}{\partial t} âˆ’ J_m$
- Quantization of all electric charge as proposed by Dirac
	- $2q_eq_m=n\pi$
- We would be able to catalyze proton decay via the Rubakov-Callan effect.
	- With this, we could get energy from protons using monopoles without using up the monopole itself.
- Other than that technological impact would likely be zero since they are rare.
