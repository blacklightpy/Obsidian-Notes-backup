If the users are not going to make use of a certain feature, and if it does not provide any aesthetic value, then it shouldn't be included as a fill component.

That is,
- An un-noticeable detail in a sculpture or a painting would be valid.
- Similarly, an un-noticeable detail in a component's aesthetic design would be valid.
- This is the UI design part.

- But additional details like listing enterprise offerings in a consumer oriented network service would be invalid.
- Similarly, providing details which a person is less likely to be interested in, or placing potentially interesting details in a place that a person is less likely to check out would be invalid too.
- This is the UX design part.
