This is all about finding what people want to see.

**Why is this fair (as opposed to some scientific sorting)?**

Because scientific methodology is merely the collection of steps to validate our shared experience of reality. Ultimately, our senses are based on clustering related observations, and in case of data, this tends to be "pick and choose". So the right way of presenting content is by optimizing the results based on metrics like popular interest, content accuracy and content keywords.

**Similarities between truth and what we want to see:**

TRUTH:
- Scientific Methodology
- Scientific Consensus

DESIRE:
- Community Consensus
- Personal Desire

In both cases, we care about consensus. Science is not a logical construct that is self-contained, but a process of recording observations in such a way that it can be reproduced in front of others.

#transfer-elsewhere for example: if you perform a trick and record it, but you cannot explain it to someone else, then it cannot be considered science, unless it's like that specific person cannot see it, but some others can. For example, if you tell a colour blind person that there are two separate colours when you perform an experiment, they may not be able to see that. You can still make it scientific, knowing by deeper experimentation that colour is a product of how cells react to light particles.
