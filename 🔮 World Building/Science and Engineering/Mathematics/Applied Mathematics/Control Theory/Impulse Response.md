In [[signal processing]] and [[control theory]], impulse response or impulse response function (IRF) of a [[Dynamical System|dynamical system]] is its output when presented with a brief input signal, called an [[impulse]] ($\delta(t)$).

More generally, an impulse response is the reaction of any dynamic system in response to some external change.
# Modelling
It is modelled in continuous time systems by using the [[Dirac Delta Function]], and using the Kronecker delta for discrete time systems.
