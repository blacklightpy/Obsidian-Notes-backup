From here, I took a detour to Mechanisms, and from there, Hoberman Mechanism> Hoberman Sphere, Then to defining polygons > Then to Euclid's theorems and all those terms, up to projections.

Then I took notes on Cockcroft-Walton Generator and Voltage Multipliers, and reached Graph Theory from electronics.
