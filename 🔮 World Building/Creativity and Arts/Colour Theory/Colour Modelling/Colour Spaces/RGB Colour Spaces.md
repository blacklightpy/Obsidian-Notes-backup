They refer to any [[Colour Space]] based on the [[RGB Colour Model]].

An RGB colour space is defined by [[Chromaticity]] coordinates of red, green and blue [[Primary Colours|additive primaries]], the [[White Point]] which is usually defined by a [[Standard Illuminant]] and the [[Collected Knowledge/Transfer Function]] which is also known as the [[Tone Response Curve]] or [[Gamma Correction|Gamma]].

The primary colours are often specified using their [[CIE xyY Colour Space|xyY]] chromaticity coordinates, although the u',v' coordinates from the [[CIE 1976 Uniform Colour Spaces|UCS]] chromaticity diagram may also be used.
