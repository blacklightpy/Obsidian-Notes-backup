This is in response to several people claiming martial arts like Tai Chi is superstitious inferior to the more pragmatic MMA.

See, for example, the "channeling your chi" in Tai Chi doesn't mean having magical superpowers. It refers to your spirit, and it has to be free.

For example, an angry man is likely to demolish a normal man, regardless of strength. Who wins will be the one who is angrier. But by learning martial arts, you learn how to fight in a focused manner, so if a stronger guy attacks you, you know how to evade the blows.

For this reason, martial arts are less often about fighting, and more about defense. Also because it trains one to remain focused and have control over their minds, someone trained in martial arts is less likely to be interested in fighting someone to win. They are more likely to not want to hurt people.

Of course, one can learn to use it to fight, but only by his intention to use it for revenge. That is, because martial arts teach you how a person is likely to attack and what one's weak points are and how someone is likely to behave.

There you go, this is all I have to say in response to people trying to "disprove" martial arts. It's not about magic powers, it's about focus and mindset.
