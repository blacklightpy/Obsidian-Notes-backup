- Resolution in arc-seconds per pixel
	- An arc second is a unit of measurement of the sky, and is equal to 1/360th of 1 degree.
	- Arc-seconds per pixel = Pixel size (microns) x Focal Length/206.265
- Guiding (manual movement of camera) and Seeing (atmospheric movement of light)
	- FWHM
- Dawes Limit - Formula for the maximum resolving power of a telescope
	- R = 11.6/D | D is the aperture of main lens in cm | R is the Resolving power of the instrument.
	- R = 4.56/D | D is the aperture of main lens in inches
