# Tips
- Sunny 16 Rule
	- On a sunny day, if the camera f-number is f/16, then the ISO should be the inverse of shutter speed i.e. if the shutter speed is 1/100, ISO should be 100 and if it is 1/200, ISO should be 200, etc.
	- This results in an EV of 14.646
- Times to shoot
	- [[Golden Hour]] for warm tones
	- [[Blue Hour]] for cooler tones
