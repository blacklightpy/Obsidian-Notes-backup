In Geological History, we standardize on the Geological Time Scale (GTS).

The definition of standardized international units of GTS is the responsibility of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), a constituent body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). Their primary objective is to precisely define global chronostratigraphic units of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart (ICC), which are in turn used to define geochronological units.
# The Geological Time Scale
The GTS is divided into chronostratigraphic units and their corresponding geochronologic units.

> [!NOTE]
> - **Chronostratigraphy** is a part of **stratigraphy**. **Stratigraphy** is the branch of geology concerned with the study of rock layers (strata) and layering (stratification).
> - Chronostratigraphy is one of the three subdivisions of stratigraphy (the other two being lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy), dealing with placing an absolute age to rock strata. By placing absolute ages on rock strata, we are able to relate them to their relative formation in time, and hence assign geochronological time periods to them.
> - A **chronostratigraphic unit** is a body of rock, layered or unlayered, that is defined between stratigraphic horizons which represent specified intervals of geologic time. They include all rocks representative of a specific interval of geologic time.
> - **Geochronology** is the branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks, fossils and sediments either through absolute or relative means.
> - A **geochronological unit** is a subdivision of geologic time.

In simple terms, chronostratigraphy deals with the dating of physical evidence, and geochronology deals with forming the temporal evidence extrapolated from it. In other words, chronostatigraphic units define a rock's identity according to age, while geochronographic units define the time period in which the rock was formed.

Much like saying "Egyptian Civilization" formed in "3 Millenia BC".

> [!NOTE] How chronostratigraphic units are separated, and hence geochronometric units are defined
> A **Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP)** is an internationally agreed upon reference point on a stratigraphic section which defines the lower boundaries of stages on the geologic time scale. (Recently this has been used to define the base of a system)
> 
> A **Global Standard Stratigraphic Age (GSSA)** is a numeric only, chronologic reference point used to define the base of geochronologic units prior to the Cryogenian period. These points are arbitrarily defined. They are used where GSSPs have not yet been established. Research is ongoing to define GSSPs for the base of all units that are currently defined by GSSAs. 

The units used in GTS are as follows:

| Chronostratigraphic Units (Strata Type) | Geochronometric Units (Time) | Time Span                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eonothem                                | Eon                          | Several hundred million years to two billion years          |
| Erathem                                 | Era                          | Tens to hundreds of millions of years                       |
| System                                  | Period                       | Millions of years to tens of millions of years              |
| Series                                  | Epoch                        | Hundreds of thousands of years to tens of millions of years |
| Subseries                               | Subepoch                     | Thousands of years to millions of years                     |
| Stage                                   | Age                          | Thousands of years to millions of years                     |
