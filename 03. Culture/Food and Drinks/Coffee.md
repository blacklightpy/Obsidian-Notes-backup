Coffee is a cherry fruit. Green coffe beans are the raw seeds which are processed and roasted to a certain taste profile before they are used to make the coffee drink.

# Third-Wave Coffee Drinks
It refers to considering coffee as an aritsanal food, like wine. It involves appreciating the nuances of flavour, sourcing of the beans and the method of preparation. The "third-wave" name is copied from the "three waves of feminism".

## Starbucks Coffee
They basically have hot/cold coffee/tea/drinks, and then Frappuccino blends.

Basically they are either of the main coffee types with flavour variations (except for the Nitrogen infusion I found, in the Nitro variants).

Also some names are Spanish (e.g. "Con Panna" means "with cream").
### Frappuccino (Blended Beverages)
They are Coffee or cream base drinks, blended with ice and syrups, topped with whipped cream and/or spices.

It may also include blended Starbucks cold drinks.
It is also high in sugar.

# Ingredients
**Note:** I found that most on the market are not either Arabica or Robusta, but rather a mix of both. Starbucks does the same thing, but with more attention and better descriptions.
## Coffee Beans
- Arabica Coffee Beans (Smooth, Less Bitter)
- Robusta Coffee Beans (Strong, Caffeine-Rich)
### Available as
- Whole Beans (Unroasted / Roasted to a degree; for fresh/customized grinding)
- Ground Coffee (Coarse, Medium, Fine, Extra-fine)
- Instant Coffee (Soluble, extracted after brewing and evaporating water)

The level to which you roast the whole beans sets the flavour of coffee. Starbucks gives three grades of roasts (Blonde, Medium, Dark).

The size to which you grind the beans sets the suitable brewing method. It also sets the level of extraction you get. The longer method you use, the coarser the coffee should be.
## Syrup
- (Recipes are free, or you can get from store)
	- Basically boil sugar + water (+flavour bean) then heat for 5 min and cool it
# Equipment
### Brewing Equipment
- French Press (For flavour-rich cup of coffee)
- Espresso Machine (For espressos)
- Pour-over / Drip Coffee Maker (Purer Taste, water flows over coffee beans)
- Filter (Indian Style)
- Percolator (Device for what Indians pour from one glass to another)
- Moka Pot (Pressurized steam driven through ground coffee)

> [!NOTE]
> Most countries seem to either pour hot water over filter or percolate, but in India we add coffee to hot water, then filter and then percolate for uniformly distributing the taste.
### Grinder
- Blade Grinder
- Burr Grinder (Gets consistent grind)
### Other
- Frother (for frothing milk)
# Tips
### Brewing (Setting Flavour Extraction Level)
