This is generally described as SQL vs NoSQL.

| Property    | Structured DBs                                                     | Unstructured DBs                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Structure   | Helps with complex queries, but is hard to modify to fit new data  | Helps with semi-structured data, and is easy to modify                                           |
| Scaling     | Designed with vertical scaling in mind (adding RAM, Storage, CPUs) | Designed with horizontal scaling (sharding) in mind (adding more machines side by side)          |
| Cost        | Requires a lot of performance                                      | Can adapt to any machine system, easy-going                                                      |
| Security    | They are not designed to be as secure as unstructured databases    | Since they are designed to be sharded, they were designed with security and self-healing in mind |
| Flexibility |                                                                    |                                                                                                  |
