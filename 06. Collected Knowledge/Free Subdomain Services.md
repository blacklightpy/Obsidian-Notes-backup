Top Level Domains are paid, so we might expect some providers to give free access to subdomains under their domain with DNS resolution. Some providers provide DNS hosting, while others allow pointing to an external nameserver.

# Free Subdomain providers
- FreeDNS (https://freedns.afraid.org)
- eu.org (`nic.eu.org`, `eu.org`)
- deSec (`desec.io`, provides `dedyn.io` subdomains)
