I mean this to include hacking software, prompt injections (on AI Models), doublespeak (linguistics), and war.
## Linguistics
- Doublespeak can be used to fulfil political agendas.
- Incoherent speech otherwise can be used to waste a person's time.
## Prompt Injections
- People have used doublespeak to break LLM models to access hidden prompts.
## Software Hacking
- Need to study computer and OS architecture.
## Radio Hacking
- Need to study DSP.
## War
- Need to study military tactics.
