After machining, there are always some scratch marks left behind. These parts are polished to attain a certain look and feel, and this is called surface finishing.

From Wikipedia: Finishing processes may be employed to: improve appearance, adhesion or wettability, solderability, corrosion resistance, tarnish resistance, chemical resistance, wear resistance, hardness, modify electrical conductivity, 

# Types of finishing
Generallly, they are of two types:
1. Removing or reshaping
2. Adding or altering

## Examples
They vary by the material in context (e.g. Textiles, Wood, Metal, Wood, Cement, Jewellery, etc.)

- Mirror Finish
- Shiny finish
- Matte Finish
- Coarsely Grained Finished
- Anti-microbial finish (Textiles)

# Methods of finishing
- Sanding and Polishing
	- Can be done by hand, or by other techniques for hard to reach areas
- Electric Discharge Machine (EDM) Spark Erosion
	- Largely Replaced by Chemical Etching
- Media Blasting
	- Example: Silica, Glass, Aluminium Oxide, Dry Ice, Plastic Beads, etc.
- Chemical Etching
- Laser Etching

# Some facts
- Material Removal is about 0.0003" - 0.0007" for most polishing applications after machining

# Examples
## Common Examples
### Leather
Somehow shoe polish makes leather shoes shine, when applied with polish brush. The type of brush fibers also play a role.

### Metal
In school we used to use Brasso for polishing school emblem and belt. Brasso is an inflammable material.

## Industrial
### Plastic
An example I saw on shorts:

This seems to be an example of shiny finish.
- Take the plastic trim, sand it in the sun
- Rub it with an 800 Wetordry paper
- Clean it up with alcohol wipes
- Prime it with a plastic primer (was Plastic Spray PS 12)
	- Add at least 3 coats of a normal primer
- When it is done, rub it with a 1500 wetordry paper
- Now apply the base coat, one that also contains a lacquer (was MOTIP Car Paint Acryl | Autolak / Autolack)
- When it is dry, again rub it with a 1500 wetordry paper
- Rub with a cretin compound (?) (was Menzerna MEDIUM CUT POLISH)
- After plenty of rubbing, it should start to look good
- Then add wax on to protect the painting (was Brillo Cera | Cera Briiho)
