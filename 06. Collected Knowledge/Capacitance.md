It is the ability of a device to store charge for a given applied potential difference.

A capacitor is a device that stores charge.

$\large C=Q/V$

For a parallel plate capacitor of plate area $\large A$, spaced apart at a distance $\large d$,

$\large C=\dfrac{\epsilon A}{d}$, or

$\large C=\dfrac{k \epsilon_0 A}{d}$, where $\large k$ is the dielectric constant, or relative permittivity.
