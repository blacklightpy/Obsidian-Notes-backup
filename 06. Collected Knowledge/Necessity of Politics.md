Proper political decisions have to be taken to ensure healthy coexistence for everyone in a society.

Whenever a discussion is attempted at a political issue, in addition to the proble of getting people's varying opinions across, there's also the issue of spreading of misinformation by powerful people. This is due to the fear of losing power.

People seek power over others out of insecurity, or out of the learned behaviour of pride that comes with power.

Both can technically be thought of as problems emerging from lack of faith in god.
