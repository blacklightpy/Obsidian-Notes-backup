The word kernel refers to something at the core of a system.
# Etymology
The English word comes from Middle English kernel, from Old English cyrnel, from Proto-West Germanic \*kurnil, diminutive of Proto-Germanic \*kurna ("seed, grain, corn), equivalent to "corn" + "-le". This further comes from the Proto-Indo-European \*grh-nom ("grain, worn-down"), from \*gerh- (grow old, mature).

This word is also a doublet of "grain".
