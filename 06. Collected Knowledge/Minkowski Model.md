It is a model of n-dimensional [[Hyperbolic Geometry]] in which:

- Points are represented by points on the forward sheet $S^+$ of a two-sheeted [[hyperboloid]] in (n+1)-dimensional [[Minkowski Spacetime]] or by the displacement [[Vector|vectors]] from the origin to those points
- m-planes are represented by the intersections of (m+1)-planes passing through the origin in Minkowski space with $S^+$ or by
