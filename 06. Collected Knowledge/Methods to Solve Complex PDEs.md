- Discretization Methods: [[Finite Element Method|FEM]] / FDM / FVM / BEM / High Resolution Schemes
- FEM involves more complexity. It is generally used in multiphysics, electromagnetic, structural and quantum analysis due its higher accuracy.
- Difficulty wise: FDM < FVM < FEM

# CFD Specific
- Vortex Methods (for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations), Lattice Boltzmann Method
- FVM is more commonly used in CFD. It discretizes PDEs to Algebraic Equations.
