- An electron could be a vibrating particle packed with many photons, and it would emit them during the de-excitations, and absorb them during excitations.
- The point photons would propagate outward, jumping from point to point in the vacuum energy points.
- This way, the photons retain their wave nature, but also propagate as point particles.
- And one such particle can hit the fluorescent board in the double slit experiment.
