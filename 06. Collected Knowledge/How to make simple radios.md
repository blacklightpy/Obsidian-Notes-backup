## Abstract Circuits
### Crystal Radio (AM)
- A crystal radio is the simplest type of radio receivers
- They are passive receivers, because they are not amplified with external power

	- Crystal vibrates to produce sound
	- Two coils can be used for tuning into a frequency (Selectivity)
	- Diode is used to get only the positive envelope of the AM carrier wave
	- The crystal can only react to the lower audio frequencies, not to the radio frequencies
	- A capacitor (bypass capacitor) is used to smooth out the radio waves
	- The distance between coils may cause energy loss, and this is called sensitivity
	- Bringing the coils closer will cause electromagnetic interference, and this is called coupling
