- Principles of Art
	- In order to create something beautiful, you need to use the eraser
	- Because art is not about filling the whole paper with all the colours
	- Because then you'll get black (because of subtractive mixing due to absorption of light)
	- Analogy:
		- Peace along with freedom is guaranteed in coexistence only by discipline
		- When someone breaks free of the law, they have to be restrained
	- Detail:
		- **Law enforcement** punishes people to prevent crime
		- **Defence forces** kill people to prevent crime
		- **Sensual intimacy** is restricted to prevent sex addiction and overpopulation

- Nature of Existence
	- The whirlpool in an ocean thinks it has a separate identity from the ocean
	- Analogy:
		- Space is not a region far away from you, but rather, you are in the universe, and you are the universe.
		- This analogy "you are the universe" is not to be taken in a wondrous or mystical sense
		- Rather, it is to be taken literally "you ARE the universe" - just think at the subatomic level
	- Detail:
		- Universe has a simultaneously definite and flowing structure
		- So do the oceans, they have a lot of phenomena in it
	- Appendix:
		- Space is not just free space, but rather it is descriptive of all the force fields
		- That is, what we have come to describe as spacetime and quantum fields
		- According to General Relativity, the curvature of space is called mass
		- More technically it is described by a **stress-energy-momentum-pressure tensor**
		- And the quantum field tensors are embedded in such a tensor
	- Limits of Contemporary Science:
		- The limits of our knowledge stop us at describing quantum fields in a changing spacetime
