It is an [[Electronic Oscillator]] that uses a [[Resonator|resonating]] [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[Crystal]] as a "frequency-selective element".

A commonly used crystal is [[Quartz]].
# Uses
The oscillator frequency is often used to:
- Keep track of time, in quartz wristwatches
- To provide a stable clock, in digital [[Integrated Circuit Chips|ICs]]
- To stabilize frequencies for RF transmitters and recievers
