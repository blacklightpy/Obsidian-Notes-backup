## In humans
The ovary is a [[gonad]] in the female reproductive system that produces ova. When released, an ovum travels through the fallopian tube / oviduct into the uterus. There is an ovary on the left and right side of the body.
## In botany
In the [[Flowering Plants]], an ovary is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower or [[Gynoecium]].

Specifically, it is the part of the [[pistil]] which holds the [[Ovules|ovule(s)]] and is located above or below or at the point of connection with the base of the [[petals]] and [[sepals]].
