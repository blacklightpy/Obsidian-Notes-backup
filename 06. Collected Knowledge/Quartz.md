It is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide).
# Piezoelectric Property
They have piezoelectric properties - they develop an electric potential upon the application of mechanical stress. An early use of this property was in phonograph (gramophone, record player, or turntable) pickups. Currently it is more used as a [[Crystal Oscillator]].

Quartz crystals can be made for a specific frequency.
