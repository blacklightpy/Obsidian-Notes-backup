- 1. Flow of information or events in spacetime.
- 2. I was thinking of the slowest speed possible
	- I thought the distance to start thinking with is the Planck distance
	- Planck distance in Planck time is the speed of causality.
	- But 1 Planck distance in 2 Planck time seems weird. As if things that weren't moving suddenly chose to move in some frames of the universe.
	- This led me to think back about my idea of disregarding the notion of length, and only considering velocity and momentum, or more fundamentally, just energy curvature (when you consider that the macroscopic velocity is fundamentally at the speed of causality).
	- All particles are at least oscillating at light speed. And all particles are in motion too, but constrained in place by forces so as to not wander off too far in some systems.
