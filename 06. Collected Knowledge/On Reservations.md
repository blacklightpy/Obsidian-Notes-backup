> **OBCs are treated better than Dalits**
> OBCs are treated a lot better than Dalits. Worst forms of untouchability are not practiced on them. OBCs are economically and socially way ahead of Dalits/Adivasis. They are not represented adequately in educational institutions and government jobs. Those opportunities are still with the general category.
> 
> **Discrimination of OBCs**
> Discrimination of OBC by privileged castes is in the form of social-educational exclusion, nepotism etc. There practically no physical violence against them by privileged castes. Education exclusions in the form admissions to good schools, neglect. Nepotism in job selection and promotions.
> 
> **Caste supremacists exist in all castes**
> OBCs consider themselves above Dalits and hate to be clubbed with them. Many instances of physical violence on Dalits are committed by OBCs in rural areas. One of the major complaints OBCs have is that they see Dalits become government servants and they have to address them with respect. A classic case of Thevar/Vanniyar (OBC) violence on Dalits (SC) in Tamilnadu. The same rivalry exists between Yadavs and Dalits of UP.
