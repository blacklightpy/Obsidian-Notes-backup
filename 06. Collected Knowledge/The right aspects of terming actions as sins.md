- Alcohol is haram

- It is good to think that way because alcohol is addicting and could be bad for your health

- But then people end up drinking alcohol specifically because it is termed as bad behaviour, and sometimes they don't understand why it is so

- But being bad for the sake of being bad is terrible

- As in, you don't have to drink alcohol to prove that you are a bad person, you only have to drink it if you feel like drinking alcohol - and personally I wouldn't because I don't like 

- I say that this happens specifically because religious people are so adamant on being righteous that they are insufferable, and people become bad just because they hate them

- They don't realize that they are doing self-harm just because they hate someone

- You don't bang your head against a wall because you don't like someone
