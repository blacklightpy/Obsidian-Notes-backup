- Gauss's Law
- Gauss's Law for Magnetism
- Faraday's Law
- Ampere's Law with Maxwell's Addition
	- Maxwell's Addition is displacement current, which is defined in terms of the displacement current field, D.

> A cleaner formulation using D and H: https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/5312/205108

The asymmetry of many terms in the magnetic field not having a counterpart for the electric field is because we do not have [[Magnetic Monopoles]], or magnetons.

Also, [[Displacement Current]] comes from time-varying electric fields, but when it comes to the charge term, we don't have a counterpart for magnetic fields. Or in other words, due to interaction of electric field with materials.
