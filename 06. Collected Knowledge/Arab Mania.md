This is what I prefer to call the religion of Mohammed now.

By calling it Islam, I would be associating all my words to the idea of "submission" itself, which is not what I want.

The specific religion and law provided by Mohammed is what I consider problematic.

And the word Allah, although it means "one god" in conventional speak, it's literal meaning is "the one to be worshipped".
