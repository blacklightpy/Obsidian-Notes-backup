They say the recitation was given to Mohammed in 7 different styles according to a Hadeeth, and therefore each recitation can be traced back to Mohammed.

> [!NOTE]
> The 7 Ahrufs (al-Ahruf al-Saba') are not the 7 Qira'ahs (al-Qira'at al-Saba')

Uthman took the Quran from different styles and replaced them with a single style, but omitted the diacritic marks, so some other styles too could be accommodated, while omitting many other styles. This was done because people used to criticize one another for reading the Qur'an differently, and now only one style could be used.
# The different editions
## The Seven Authoritative Reciters and Their Transmitters
The readers were from the early centuries, and their recitations were textualized by the transmitters. The transmitted forms are what we read from today. Muslims say the Quran was revealed in 7 styles to Mohammed, so all are from Allah.

# Situation and Problems
Source: https://www.ugr.es/~mreligio/materiales/Green.Samuel_The-different-arabic-versions-of-the-Quran.pdf

- Uthman destroyed all other copies of the Quran, and the differences between the ahrufs
- So the claim that any of the recitations can be traced back to Mohammed is false
- Everything can be traced back to the Uthmanic manuscript
- So there are ten Q'aris (reciters) and seven Ahrufs (modes, as per the Hadith)
- Muslims do not accept all of them as valid, they choose the best one for reading
- Because "it is ridiculous to believe that God gave the recitation in different variants and we have to pick and choose"
- There are 7 Mutawatir recitations and 3 Mashhur recitations
