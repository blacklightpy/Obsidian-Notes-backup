Linuxulator provides kernel interfaces to natively run Linux applications. But the support in FreeBSD 12 as of 2023 is for Linux kernel 4.4.0, while the mainline kernel is at version 6.6.

It may also have some other issues.

A real fix would be using a low level VM for platform independent software.
