Electrical resistivity or specific [[Electrical Resistance]] or volume resistivity is a fundamental [[Specific Property]] that measures the electrical resistance of a material, that is how strongly it resists electric current.
## Notation
It is commonly denoted by $\rho$.
## Formula
It is a fundamental property which is the constant of proportionality in the calculation of electrical resistance.
## SI Unit
Ohm metre
## Dimension
$\text{M} \text L ^ \text 3 \text T ^ \text {-3} \text I ^ \text {-2}$
