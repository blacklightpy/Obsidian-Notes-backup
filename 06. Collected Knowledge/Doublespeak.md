It refers to a language trick where one uses words that can mean multiple different things, when they could've instead used a more clear combination of words. This is used to hide an agenda while carrying it out through other means.

Example:
- **Officer-involved shooting**
	- Term
		- It's a noun phrase with no action verb
		- So we can't determine the subject and the object
	- Questions
		- Did a gun go off by accident?
		- Did the police shoot a civilian?
		- Did a civilian shoot a civilian when a police was present?
