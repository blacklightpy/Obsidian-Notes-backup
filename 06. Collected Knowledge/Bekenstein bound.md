It is an upper limit on the thermodynamic entropy $S$, or Shannon entropy $H$, that can be contained in a finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy. Or conversely, the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a system down to the quantum level.

It implies that the information of a physical system, or the information necessary to perfectly describe that system must be finite if the region of space and energy are finite.

In computer science, this implies that non-finite models such as [[Turing Machine|Turning machines]] are not realizable as finite devices.

A proof using [[Quantum Field Theory|QFT]] was given in 2008.
# Examples
- According to Bekenstein bound, the entropy of a [[black hole]] is proportional to the number of Planck areas that it would take to cover the black hole's event horizon.
