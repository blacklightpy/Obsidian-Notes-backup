Planckian locus or [[Black Body]] locus is the path or [[Locus]] that the colour of an incandescent [[Black Body]] would take in a particular [[Chromaticity]] space as the blackbody [[Temperature]] changes.

It goes from deep red at low temperatures through orange, yellowish white, white and finally bluish white at very high temperatures.
