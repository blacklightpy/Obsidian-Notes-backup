The fundamental frequency, or just the fundamental, is the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform. In [[Music Theory]], the fundamental is the musical pitch of a note that is perceived as the lowest partial present.
# In mechanical systems
For a single degree of freedom oscillator, like a mass-spring system, the natural frequency of oscillation depends on two quantities: mass and stiffness (provided the system is undamped)

$\large \omega_0 = \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}$,

where:
$\large k$ is the stiffness of the string
$\large m$ is the mass of the body
$\large \omega_0$ is the natural frequency in rad/s

In [[Modal Analysis]], the frequency of  the 1st mode is the fundamental frequency.
This is also expressed as:

$\large f_0 = \dfrac{1}{2l} \sqrt{\dfrac{T}{\mu}}$,

where:
$\large f_0$ is the natural frequency
$\large l$ is the length of the string
$\large \mu$ is the mass per unit length of the string
$\large T$ is the tension on the string
