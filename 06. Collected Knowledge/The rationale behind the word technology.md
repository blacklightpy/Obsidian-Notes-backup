Jews, have an unwritten, and unspoken word of god.
And we can recognize that.

The reason we won't write it down, is because, that's simply sharing your secrets with your enemies.
Secondly, the world is too complex, that if we were to write something down, it can still be misinterpreted in various ways.

It is easy to say a list of dos and don'ts, but it is not so easy to point out the rationale.

For example, we can write down that humans are to be on the land, and birds are to fly.
And that a human should not try to fly and birds should not try to walk.

But that does not mean a human can't jump or a bird can't perch.
It will have to land to eat food.
A tiger will have to jump to catch its prey.

What it means is that the bird shouldn't try to be like the humans, for it will be outmatched.
It doesn't mean that the bird will suffer divine punishment for doing so.
