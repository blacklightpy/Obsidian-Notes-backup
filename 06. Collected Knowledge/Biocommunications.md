Biocommunication theory may be considered to be a branch of [[Biosemiotics]]. Whereas biosemiotics studies the production and interpretation of signs and codes, biocommunication theory investigates concrete interactions mediated by signs. Accordingly, [[Syntax|syntactic]], [[Semantics|semantic]], and [[Pragmatics|Pragmatics]] aspects of biocommunication processes are distinguished.

Biocommunication specific to animals ([[Animal Communication]]) is considered a branch of [[Zoosemiotics]]. The semiotic study of [[molecular genetics]], can be considered a study of biocommunication at its most basic level.
# Examples
- Whale Vocalization
- Honey Bee Waggle Dance
- Peacock Feather Fan (to alert about territorial dangers)
# Language formats
> Given the complexity and range of biological organisms and the further complexity within the neural organization of any particular animal organism, a variety of biocommunication languages exists.
> 
> A hierarchy of biocommunication languages in animals has been proposed by Subhash Kak: these languages, in order of increasing generality, are associative, re-organizational, and quantum. The three types of formal languages of the Chomsky hierarchy map into the associative language class, although context-free languages as proposed by Chomsky do not exist in real life interactions.
