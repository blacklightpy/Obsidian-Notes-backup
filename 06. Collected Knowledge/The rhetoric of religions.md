They use words such as "lusting", etc.

If such words are used, 


AHA I found it.
1.**Lust**
Lust is described as satisfying one's pleasures at the expense of others.
Where did the "at the expense of others" come from?
See, that's how religious people jump to conclusions to demonize people.

2.**Same-Sex Relationships**
Same goes for the story of Lot in Sodom and Gomorrah.
The people of Sodom and Gomorrah are said to have been wanting to rape men.
They were also described as extremely arrogant and prideful.

But the LGBTQIA+ of today are not like that, although religious people like to group them as the same.
And "pride day" is not the same as 'pride, the sin'.
Pride day is only a celebration as much as saying I'm proud of who I am.

Perhaps, the more appropriate word is I'm happy for what I am.
But that would be semantic policing, because the language is designed that way.
Language, was always designed around a culture, regardless of whether it's oppressive or not.

3.**Pagans**
The other thing is about pagans.
Pagans were hated in the New Testament, in the Book of Mathew.

> **Mathew 5:46-48**
> And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? _Do_ not _even pagans do_ that?

Their original fault was with the Roman pagans, who were xenophobic or prideful of their gods.
The same ideas did not apply to Hindus, who would cherish the gods of other people.

In the Old Testament, the treatment of pagans were far worse.
But the reason in the Jewish religion as per the Talmud was that pagans used to sacrifice their own children to gods.
But when they came to India, this Halakhic notion did not apply, as Indians only sacrificed fruits in front of idols.
But when Christians adopted the Tanakh as the Old Testament, they took it literally, without the Rabbinistic Halakha.
