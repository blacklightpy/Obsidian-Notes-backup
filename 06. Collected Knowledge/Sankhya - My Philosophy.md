Nature (Place and Timeline) evolves so that the only soul can evolve.

After all, the witness consciousness produces multiple body instances of itself.

## What about other people?

- Well, a child definitely needs to be taken care of by parents (it can't form all its decisions by itself)
- Then the child will have to think for itself to avoid trouble, just as his parents taught it to do
- Then the child will have to go out into the world, because of the desire to rid itself of boredom, then to fulfil the natural desire for companionship

Whether he makes a new child or not, others will make new children. This continue evolution, until all people decide to not reproduce further. This would be at a state of complete spiritual evolution.

Think for example, about the suicide of the Q continuum.

But I guess, I prefer the way of being playful at all times, and using knowledge to live in peace.
