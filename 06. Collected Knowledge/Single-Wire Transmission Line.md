It uses a single conductor line instead of a pair of wires to transmit power or signals.

This is different from single-wire earth return (SWER), which relies on earth as a conductor.

Commercial Applications are unknown.

Nikola Tesla spoke about this.

- Single-Wire Earth Return
	- Avoids neutral wire
- Ground and Neutral Wires
	- GND (Ground) / COM (Common): A reference point, usually taken to be 0V
	- Neutral (The return wire)
- Live Wire, Neutral Wire and Earth Wire
	- Red (Live Wire): Taken as having voltage
	- Black (Neutral Wire): Return wire, taken as 0V
	- Green (Earth Wire): Wire to Mother Earth, either from appliance, or from neutral wire (Teachoo article said Mother Earth XD)
		- Grounding is done both at home and at the transformer - those are the two grounds

> [!note]
> Neutral Wire is safe to touch because it is near the 0V point (so the circuit gradient makes it 0V near that point) - But don't test it too much. The differences maybe higher if the wire isn't close to GND.

> Home connections are 1 phase, industrial is 3 phase. A phase and neutral is used to power a simple circuit.

> In Serbia, households use 3 phase power as it reduces the amount of current a single wire would carry. It helps give voltage stability as well, by not overloading a single line.
