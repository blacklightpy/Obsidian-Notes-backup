- Kaiteki: Tested with Mastodon and Firefish, and looks dope
- Mastodon App: Mastodon only, and UI is fully featured, yet not the most awesome
- Fedilab: Supports Mastodon and Peertube, does not work with Firefish, not great UI and is paid on Play Store.
- Pixelfed App: Not upto the mark, for me
- Pixelcat: Looks more unpolished than Pixelfed official app
