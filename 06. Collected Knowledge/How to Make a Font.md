# Terminology

Typeface: The character list
Font: A typeface at a given size and weight
Font Family: Typeface at varying weights
Weight: Bold, Regular, Thin, etc.
Character: A single element of a font
Glyph: The representation(s) of a given character.

## Styles
Serif, Sans Serif, Slab Serif
Antiqua/Old Style/Black Text
Cursive: Joined handwriting typefaces
Script: More formal than cursive

## Variations
Condensed
Italic: Redesign of Roman typeface, not merely slanted
### Weights
Roman: Regular weight of a typeface

## Views
Oblique/Slanted: Tilted standard typeface

## Design
Body: Invisible space occupied by a character
Axis/Stress: Line drawn through the middle of a character, from it's thinnest top and bottom point (in a serif O)
Baseline
Ascender
Descender
Cap Height
x-Height/Midline
Kerning: Design level letter spacing, dictates how far individual letters are spaced from one another

## Typesetting
Tracking/Letter Spacing: Adjustment done in web design / typesetting where the spacing is adjusted aside from default kerning
Leading/Line Spacing: Spacing between lines
Word Spacing: Distance between two words

## Rendering
Rasterization - involves Anti-Aliasing and Hinting

## CSS
### Units
Absolute Units:
cm
in
pc = pixel
pt = 1/12th of a px

Relative Units:
px: Magical unit that adjusts to screen size
em: Relative width of the point size
ex: Relative to the x-height

### Variables
font-size
line-height
letter-spacing
font-kerning (Usually specified in quality fonts)

# Tips
1. Create a brief for what you want out of the font
2. Design font on paper first
3. Use control characters to help design (lowercase=n, o; uppercase=H, O)
4. Switch to PC by uploading your sketch
5. Use a font editor and create the glyphs
6. Test the font in typing mode, at different sizes and in paragraphs

## Kerning
1. You have to kern each letter individually
2. Kerning is all about feeling
3. Test kerning when size changes
4. Practice Game: https://type.method.ac/
5. Letters to keep an eye on
	1. Slanted Letters: A, K, V, W, Y
	2. Letters with arms or cross-strokes: F, T, L
	3. Letter combinations: W or V + A; F or T + a lowercase vowel
6. Two straight lines need the most space: II > IO > OO
7. Try flipping the letters upside down, so you can see the spaces unbiased

## Hinting
Happens automatically, but can be set manually in font editors with TrueType instructions
e.g. SNAGW (Set Angle Weight), MDAP (Move Direct Absolute Point)

# Design Basics
- Words must be spaced more than letters, to form distinct units.
