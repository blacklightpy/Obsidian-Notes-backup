It is a 3-dimensional [[Euclidean Space]], denoted by $\Bbb R^3$ (or $\Bbb E^3$).

Originally, in Euclid's [[Elements by Euclid|Elements]], it was the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, but in modern mathematics there are Euclidean spaces of any positive integer dimension n, which are called Euclidean n-spaces when one wants to specify their dimension
