This is a topic that's often avoided, but the similarities can be seen easily.

Judaism used to believe that we turn to dust, prior to encountering Zoroastrianism. Zoroaster came up with the idea that there is one perfect god, and all other gods and idols are fake, and that there is hell and heaven.

Meanwhile Muslims agree, and say that Zoroaster was a prophet sent by Allah, and the true Avestas were altered. (https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/ntss3p/islam_has_plagiarized_zoroastrianism_a_religion/k818dv5/)

As per Islam, god has sent more than 180,000 messangers all over the world.


"ahhhh ..... how should i put this . zoroastrianism is a corrupted islam , like christianity and judaism." (https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/ntss3p/islam_has_plagiarized_zoroastrianism_a_religion/h2bs70s/)

Islam emphasizes on truth being spread by different prophets, therefore syncretism (inheritance of religous ideas) is not entirely off the chart, it's just that the Quran is the final word, the lens through which they view all other faiths.

"God had decreed the same duties unto men since the first man. Secondly, God had decreed the same duties to each and every Prophet because He wanted at least of these duties to be in place until the last man."

"If they want higher rank in the judgement of Allah, they should follow the code"
