Genesis 38:8-10:
 
> (Genesis 38:8): "Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.”"
> (Genesis 38:9): "But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother."
> (Genesis 38:10): "What he did was wicked in the Lord’s sight; so the Lord put him to death also."

- Firstly, the asking him to sleep with his brother's wife is traditionally weird.
- Secondly, I don't see why one should find it weird that the child born from him having sex will not be his.
- Normally, people are afraid that the child they are raising is not theirs due to infidelity, not the other way round.
- Thirdly, it is stupid that he chose to have sex because god commanded him to, but he didn't follow the full command because he did not like it. Then why did he follow through in the first place?
- Fourthly, god killed him for this act. Christians probably won't find it weird, but a god who can create the world could also be a good teacher and tell the person why something must be done.
	- If it's simply a commandment for the sake of it, Christians can't argue that it is good.
	- It is simply good in the eyes of god, and pathetic in the eyes of anyone who hasn't totally discarded their natural beliefs for the teachings of this religion.
	- The effect being them always feeling like a sinner, and begging for mercy for what seems like a self-inflicted sin.
	- You see, nothing stops someone from believing in something that's not real and being affected by it.
	- And common sense goes against the teachings of this religion, and hence why can't I say that it is much more likely that this is all cooked up than real?
	- And if I can prove that, why exactly would someone still believe in this religion, aside from blind faith?
	- If so, isn't that simply because that's what their parents taught them to believe, as opposed what they understood for themselves?
	- I know it gives comfort, but that doesn't make it right.
