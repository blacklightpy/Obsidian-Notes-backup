A religion puts a limit on people beliefs.

For example, one could say that by staying in touch with the infinite vastness of the universe by meditation, one could see through the worldly illusions and structures.

However, religions limit the ability of one to know infinity. In Abrahamic religions, god is the creator of the universe, and he is the only one who is infinitely vast. By having such an organized faith, even if it was possible for us to realize oneness with the infinite, it would not be possible, because by belief, we have surrendered that capability of ours to an abstract external entity.

For example, if a religion was to say that heat should only be generated by god, building an artificial heater would be banned, and hence that civilization would not survive a cold era.

Because religions are not scientific, their dogmas have no place for questioning, and hence these rules are being followed by blind faith. And while having blind faith alone is not bad, restricting one to one specific blind faith which limits other equally possible faiths is bad.
