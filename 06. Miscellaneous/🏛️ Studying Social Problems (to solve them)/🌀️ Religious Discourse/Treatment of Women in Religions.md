Even when religions claim to respect women, that poses its own set of problems.
# Women are put on a pedestal
- They are not supposed to be angry, because they are the emotionally understanding ones
- They are supposed to put up with all the problems of men
- That is, only men have real problems, and women are just counselors
- Mothers are seen as goddesses than human beings
# They are also seen as special property
- That is, if a woman cheats on a man, the person she cheated with is in risk, even to the point of being murdered
- That is, the woman had no right to choose who she wanted to be with, it's always the fault of the man for stealing the woman
- If a man cheats on a woman, such a problem never happens, because men are not property, women are
- Same goes for a man in a relationship with the girl in religions where women are supposed to marry the man her father chooses

- Islam has the same problem, but with the addition of a man being able to marry four women and divorce them at will, however a women not being able to do so
