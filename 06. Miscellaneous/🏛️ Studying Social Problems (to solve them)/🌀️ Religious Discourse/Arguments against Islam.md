Tenets being:

- Life is a test
- Satan is allowed to tempt
- You can disobey Allah even without Satan
- Allah is just. His promise is only that the next life will be just.
- Allah sent many prophets to show signs, so he cannot be critiqued

Observations:

- Islam is an angry religion as it forces people to be on guard 24/7
- That is true, although the people are in high faith, in fact, they are high on faith

Arguments:

- Why should Allah test instead of just making people's lives easy?
- Why does he demand obedience from people whom he know has desires, and he himself created the ability to feel those desires?
- They say god doesn't tempt, but god is the one who created the ability to be tempted, and also the apparent tempter
- This is textbook narcissism
- Isn't this entire argument coming from people who cannot find happiness in the difficulties of the existing world? Perhaps if they understood the nature of coexistence, they would understand how to be happy.
- Justice, and complete happiness is fleeting. Heaven is boring. Coexistence, and its uncertainty is what anyone likes.

More Arguments:
- Islam makes women hide their entire bodies, however sex slaves are ok, which encourages men to invade other countries to rape women ("Also ˹forbidden are˺ married women—except ˹female˺ captives in your possession. This is Allah’s commandment to you...." [Quran 4:24])
- Apparently Mohammed could neither read, nor write?? Still, speech is language, to be confused by.
- God is insecure, so he needed to create temptations so people would forcefully worship him to prevent the punishment.
- The highest goods in heaven are stuff like women, cars, etc. So why not just get them at earth?
- Being a so called righteous man, Mohammed married Aisha at 6, and consummated the marriage (i.e. had sex with her) when she was 9. Islam allows marrying prior to menstruation, and it only says that intercourse should only be done when the girl is able to. This doesn't specify an age, and can be misused.
  - Scholars vary on opinion, but that itself is a problem here, because there is no single truth.
- It says everyone who Mohammed married asked him to marry them, which sounds too made up for someone who had just murdered their entire families. It's the definition of "asking for it". Again, it's based on the Hadiths only. For those who invoke the Hadith, these apply.

My faith is based on that the purpose of life is to explore and have fun. Even if there was a god, he would be of the same belief, not a passive-aggressive sadistic narcissist who demands strict obedience from innocent people who have natural desires he himself created. So I wouldn't need to worry about it at all. 

The rest of my words are to guide others to this simple truth.
