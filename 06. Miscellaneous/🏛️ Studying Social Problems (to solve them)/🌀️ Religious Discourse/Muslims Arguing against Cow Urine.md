Firstly, Hinduism considers cows sacred due to their provision of milk, which can make butter and ghee. The urine as medicine is an Ayurvedic practice, which was developed by Hindu scholars, but it is not part of the Hindu faith.

Prophet Mohammed asked his followers to drink camel urine as medicine in the Hadith: https://sunnah.com/bukhari/76/9

Some people on Quora defended this claim by backing it up with scientific papers.

One person on Quora argues against this by saying that:
> - If one Hadith disagrees with another, we take the most accurate one
> - Hadiths stress on the importance of cleanliness
> - We know that all animal urine is filthy
> - Hence, camel urine is also filthy
> - In Islam we say "EVERYTHING WAS HALAL UNTIL PROVEN HARAM"
> - Since it is proven haram, it is not to be followed
> - Islam is a religion based on facts and practicality. Superstitious and illogical behaviour is condemned in Islam.
> - Fabricating the teachings of Islam and Mohammed is a major sin

How terrible. They use science whenever it's in their favour, never does actual science, but only use wild reasoning (just like how they prove god using the Kalam cosmological argument, and also add in from nowhere that this is the word of god).

They never really proved anything as Haram for all mankind, but only for those who believe in that faith. There is nothing to get someone to believe in that faith, except fearmongering. Same applies for Christianity and Judaism, but Islam has an additional political problem of not being able to turn back once they are a Muslim, which will be seen as treachery.
