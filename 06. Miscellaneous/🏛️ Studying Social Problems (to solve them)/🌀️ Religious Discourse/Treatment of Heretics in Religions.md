## Abrahamic Religions
- While Muslims are judged more harshly by the world for their active action in the purification of the world according to their ideals, by _Salafist Jihad_, the other two religions are also pretty terrible in their beliefs.
  - According to the Hebrew bible, when the Messiah comes at the end of days, he will get rid of all the Gentiles who don't follow the 7 Noahide laws, creating the world to come on Earth.
 
## Hinduism
- Sins are not properly defined, however the casteist sects have imposed their own laws to control people by superstitions. This takes forms of oppression in the current world, and also beliefs about irrepariable sins, for which they will be punished in the afterlife. The afterlife can be divided into Deva Lokam (Heaven), Manushya Lokam (Human), Tiryanch Lokam (Animals, Birds, Insects, Plants), Naraka Lokam (Hell).
