- Some also say that Shia Islam is tending towards liberalism, while Sunni Islam tends to preserving Islamic values.


- Currently the only Shia dominant country is Iran
	- Before the fall of Shah in 1979, Iran was a very secular and modern.
	- Now, it is highly restrictive, with women wearing full black burqas.



- Indonesia is the largest Sunni dominated countries and is less restrictive, with girls wearing just a headscarf
	- I hear the public is still striving for conservatism, with one province, Ache getting Shariah law for itself.
- But Saudi Arabia is the spiritual heart of Sunni Islam, but it is very restrictive
- Morocco is very liberal, and is considered more Western than many of their neighbours.
	- I hear the liberalism is forced in Morocco by the Western dictatorship, and the public isn't happy with it.
- Jordan is more traditional than Morocco, but more restrictive than Saudi Arabia.
- UAE is hailed as the most liberal and progressive place in the world.
- Sunni Islam in Afghanistan is labelled as the most restrictive and most anti-Western Muslim country
