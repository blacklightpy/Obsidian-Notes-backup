Islam is a religion, much like many other religions, often misrepresented by taking words out of context. I'm not saying it's all right, but I'm saying that many times, people argue about specific verses without understanding the context. I've read several parts of the Quran to know the real context, and hence I can provide a summary of those verses and give you the right context from the Quran itself.
# The ones I can defend

# The ones I can't defend
- (Quran 3:32): "Say, "Obey Allah and the Messenger." But if they turn away - then indeed, Allah does not like the disbelievers."
	- It says follow Allah and the Messenger. Because of having to obey the Messenger, one also has to follow the Hadiths aside from the Quran, so it also brings in all the unfair practices, including the Shariah law and Jihad.
	- It can also be reasoned that the Quran can be used as a tool to verify what is right in the Jewish Tanekh and follow that. After all, the Talmuds are the base scriptures of Islam, and the Quran is presented as the final word clearing up the mistakes that have accumulated in the Torah over the years.
- According to 2:191, persecution is worse than murder. Along with it, Islam, like Judeo-Christianity has verses against homosexuality, which would lead to people wanting to choose murdering the LGBTQIA+ population.
- Not a verse, but the Taqiyya is dangerous!
# Taqiyya

Quranic basis:
>
>The technical meaning of the term _taqiyya_ is thought[_[by whom?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] to be derived from the [Quranic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") reference to religious dissimulation in [Sura 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sura_3 "Sura 3"):28:
>
> Believers should not take disbelievers as guardians instead of the believers—and whoever does so will have nothing to hope for from Allah—unless it is a precaution against their tyranny. And Allah warns you about Himself. And to Allah is the final return. (_illā an **tattaqū** minhum **tuqāt**_).
> 
> — [Surah Al Imran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Imran "Al Imran") [3:28](https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=28)
>
> The two words _tattaqū_ ("you fear") and _tuqāt_ "in fear" are derived from the same root as _taqiya_, and use of the abstract noun _taqiya_ in reference to the general principle described in this passage is first recorded in a Qur'anic gloss by [Al-Bukhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Bukhari "Muhammad al-Bukhari") (9th century).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

> Regarding 3:28, [Ibn Kathir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Kathir "Ibn Kathir") writes, "meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly." He quotes [Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad")'s companion, [Abu Ad-Darda'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ad-Darda%27 "Abu Ad-Darda'"), who said "we smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them," and [Al-Hasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_ibn_Ali "Hasan ibn Ali") who said "the Tuqyah is acceptable till the Day of Resurrection."

> A similar instance of the Qur'an permitting dissimulation under compulsion is found in [Surah An-Nahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An-Nahl "An-Nahl") [16:106](https://quran.com/16?startingVerse=106) Sunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse 16:106 refers to the case of ['Ammar b. Yasir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammar_ibn_Yasir "Ammar ibn Yasir"), who was forced to renounce his beliefs under physical duress and torture.
