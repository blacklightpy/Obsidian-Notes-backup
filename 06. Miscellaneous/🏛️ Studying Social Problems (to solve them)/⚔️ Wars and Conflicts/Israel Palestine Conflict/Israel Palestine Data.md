# Levels of Verification

- Level 1 - Completely Disproven

###### 40 Babies were beheaded
- Status: Level 2
- Claim: 40 Babies were beheaded by Hamas
- Proof given: Pictures of blood stained rooms.
- Suspicious data: Some of the stains were pink
- Invalidating Argument: Deoxygenated blood stains won't leave pink stains. No clear proof was given.
	- Israeli citizens say that the requests for actual photos are inhuman, and they often respond with "shame on you" for making such requests.
	- Israel's official social media handle has also posted "shame on you" as part of their awareness campaign.
- Further reports:
	- The reporter who first reported this, said that she heard about it from some IDF soldier.
	- Later IDF denied it had solid reports that babies were killed, and whether any count was taken.
	- Yet Israel's official social media handles have posted this information several times.

###### Rockets launched on the Al-Ahli Arab hospital
- Status: Level 4
- Claim (from Israel): The rockets were a failed launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)
- Claim (from Palestine): The rockets could've only been from Israel
- Proofs Given (from Israel)
	- They've claimed that they analyzed the trajectory of the rockets and found out that it's from the PIJ
	- 
- 
- Personal thoughts:
	- I find it confusing how the misfired rocket managed to hit directly at a hospital, also a few days after Israel asked Hospitals to evacuate.

	- [X post](https://x.com/alextomo/status/1714670858914894046?s=20) by @alextomo, a journalist of Channel 4 News, stating:
		- "Several experts confirm Hamas’ view to @Channel4News that the audio tape of “Hamas” operatives talking about the missile malfunction is a fake. They say the tone, syntax, accent and idiom are absurd."
- IDF claims they found evidence that Hamas keeps curtains uselessly covering white walls to use them as spots to record hostages inside Al-Shifa
	- [Instagram Reel video post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Czvtj-Rss75/) by @muslim.daily pointing out the absurdity of this, because those curtains were used by their mothers to make the plain rooms look more 'chic'.
