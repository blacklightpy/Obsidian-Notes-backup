- Oct 7 2023 Hamas attack and kidnapping hostages
	- Started the Israel-Hamas War 2023
	- Israel asked civilians to relocate south, then bombed the evacuation route
	- Israel cut off electricity and water supply to Gaza
	- Bombed Hospital (French Intelligence claims it was not Israeli missiles, IDF and Hamas blame each other)
	- Israel returned water in limited supply
	- Israel Bombed a church
	- Israel is controlling the media, censoring the good sides of Hamas
	- Israel believes Hamas is in north Gaza
	- Israel gave an ultimatum that whoever resides in north Gaza will be seen as a terrorist
	- Israel doesn't consider that it was the home of civilians of Gaza
	- Israel bombed the entrance to Rafa crossing
	- Egypt asked Gazan citizens to stay in the land and fight, rather than lose the land as refugees
	- Egypt had to wait a long time before they could cross Rafa
	- Hamas released 2 hostages, unscathed
	- One of them didn't say anything bad about Hamas, and was kind of chill, but the media twisted her words anyways
	- Hamas released 2 more elder women hostages, one of them whom shook hands with Hamas soldier, said Salam and told how Hamas treated her very attentively and kindly, and didn't hurt her due to their following of Quran
	- Israel blames media for letting her give PR to Hamas
	- Israel says presenting both sides of the argument is the same as supporting Hamas - a classic flaw that just says you don't have anything true on your side, so you have to hide the reports of the other side.
	- Hostages have blamed Israel for shooting captives, which is a thing for their military officers at least, according to their Hannibal Directive. This may have been extended to the civilian hostages now.
