It is a separationist movement by the Sikhs of Punjab who want a state for the Sikhs, with a major motive being having more share of the water from the Sutlej river.

Former PM Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her bodyguards, who were Sikhs, in retaliation to Operation Blue Star run under her command, which was aimed at removing the Sikh militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and other Sikh separationists from the Golden Temple. The Khalistani miliants had assassinated several Hindus, Nirankaris and even Sikhs opposing Bhindranwale.

Though it was common knowledge that those responsible for such bombings and murders were taking shelter in gurdwaras, the INC Government of India declared that it could not enter these places of worship, for the fear of hurting Sikh sentiments. Even as detailed reports on the open shipping of arms-laden trucks were sent to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Government choose not to take action. Finally, following the murder of six Hindu bus passengers in October 1983, emergency rule was imposed in Punjab, which would continue for more than a decade.
