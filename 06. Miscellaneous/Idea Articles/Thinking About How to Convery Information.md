Information is hard to read, so you have to keep it minimal.

Still, you need to convey all the essential knowledge to a wide range of people. This is a form of art.

For example, consider your article requires knowledge about a broad topic, say "calculus". So we only want to convey the basic knowledge about calculus to the uninitiated folks.

But if we do include an explanation, even the ones who are familiar with calculus, but don't have mastery over the very large subject may waste their time going through that section. So, it is better to inform beforehand the level of expectation, and to keep the prerequisite knowledge notes short, and link to a separate note for more detail.

This way, we can help a wider range of users go through our content easily!
