- Electromagnetic field is like water
- Photons are like waves
- Electrons are like molecules
- When we see water, we don't see the atoms, we also see what's not covered by atoms
- In fact, we only see what connects the atoms - the electromagnetic field
- When atoms move, the field moves, and what we see is the ripples
- And they will never remain still, but if they did, we wouldn't see them, and it would be dark everywhere
