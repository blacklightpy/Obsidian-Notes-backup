It is the argument used by Muslims to prove that god exists. 

KalƒÅm, or Islamic scholastic theology is the science which is concerned with firmly establishing religious beliefs by adducing proofs and with banishing doubts.

The three disputed sources of Islamic law were the ahl Al-Kalam (philosophy), ahl al-Ra'y (common sense) and ahl al-Hadith (hadith).

So the argument goes:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause of its existence.
2. The universe began to exist.
	2.1 Argument based on the impossibility of an actual infinite:
		2.11 An actual infinite cannot exist.
		2.12 An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.  
		2.13 Therefore, an infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.
	2.2 Argument based on the impossibility of the formation of an actual infinite by successive addition:
		2.21 A collection formed by successive addition cannot be actually infinite.  
		2.22 The temporal series of past events is a collection formed by successive addition.  
		2.23 Therefore, the temporal series of past events cannot be actually infinite.
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence.

What is cause and why should everything have it?

Sometimes I like some stuff, and there may not be an attributable cause for it.
If you say that the universe has some cause to exist, doesn't that the same apply to god?
Why does god exist?
If you can answer that question, why can't we just replace god with universe and see it's existence?

2.1 Why can't an infinite exist?

Just imagine a sea of water, and nothing else. Imagine it stretches on forever, and there is no end to it. Simply by this imagination, you have seen infinity. Definitely it exists in your mind, which exists in this world.

Besides, the universe doesn't have a wall, and maybe mass is just fluctuations, which just have to spread to different parts of the universe.

What exactly are you claiming cannot be infinite? Infinite has to be of something, right? Certainly, mathematics allows us to see the infinity easily, whether in infinite division or in counting, or in even weirder forms like fractals.

A simple piece of paper can be used to draw infinite images, with just one colour, all you need is a pen with a smaller tip.

And perhaps, for the universe, the total energy is finite, but it's all part of the play, and will return to itself. That's the saying that energy can neither be created, nor be destroyed. There doesn't need to be infinite number water for the oceans to make waves continuously for all eternity. It just has to form the water cycle. The argument against it is the dissipation of "free" energy. But what if the universe reclaims that energy, since it was only converted to other, unusable forms of energy. And we don't even know mysteries about the world like the observed unexplainable, or dark energy. Perhaps, we are a growth of the universe, experiencing itself.

What is 2.2?
2.2 is described simply as that an infinite distance cannot be traversed. For example, in time, if the past was infinite, then today would never arrive.

But I must ask, to arrive, where do you start from? You have to start somewhere, and if you pick a point, you have a finite distance from there! You can't start from the "beginning", because there's no beginning in infinity! But if you pick a point, you have a present.
