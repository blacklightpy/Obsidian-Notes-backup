Since this numbering has been agreed upon and is the same in Germany, Holland, Italy, and other places, so whenever I have had to differ I have indicated my difference by subdividing the clause into (a), (b), etc., so as not to interfere with the international numbering.][[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Medina#cite_note-Lecker-26)
