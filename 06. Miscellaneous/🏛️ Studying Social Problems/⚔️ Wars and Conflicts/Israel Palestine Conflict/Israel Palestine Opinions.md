###### Israel has morally corrupted the west in three weeks
The west was all about liberalism and human rights. Now they don't even want to say ceasefire or to tell Israel to stop. And McDonalds is now giving free meals to Israel citizens as if it's going to help with anything.
###### Benjamin Netanyahu helped fund Hamas
Netanyahu helped fund Hamas to ensure the conflicts remain, so that a Palestinian state never forms. They also gave the citizens of Gaza work permits to give a limited sense of peace.

This happened in 2018, when PA cut off salaries to PA employees in Gaza to exert socio-economic pressure on Hamas. The PA had originally asked its employees to not work for Hamas because they exterminated many Fatah members. At this time, Qatar decided to fund Hamas, and an anonymous report let US know this. When US asked Israel to make a decision, Netanyahu decided to allow the funding to make Hamas stronger so they stand against Fatah.
