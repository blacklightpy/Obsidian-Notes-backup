Justice only exists for the privileged. Even in a world without capitalism, privilege will exist in social circles, because that is what defines each of us as separate. Without the understanding of unity by philosophy, which is by the way, essential to removing capitalism, this way of life will continue. One of the tenets of the anti-capitalist theory of communism is that human nature is not egoistic, but rather it is a result of capitalism. If that was properly understood, as I understood it, then this wouldn't be a problem, as people would understand one another.

But without that happening, the only way for people to have justice is to take matters into their own hands. To the poor, it always seems like the people who stand for them only do it for namesake. For example, Stormfront in "The Boys" always talks about injustice in the popular social media network known as Instagram, while she herself savagely kills an innocent person and calls him a "fucking yellow bastard".
