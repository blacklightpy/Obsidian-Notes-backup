> As much as I hate "intellectual property" laws, if I don't apply a legal license to it, because of the flawed nature of the coded justice system, some other people may take my work and copyright it, because I haven't legally claimed the ownership for it myself. This is not very much sillier than the concept of humans "owning" a piece of land, but that's the only way humans have developed as a society for now. For this reason, I've applied a public domain license to my creations.

Whoever Uses Ice Cream Theory Licensed Software To Create Proprietary Software Is Without Character.
Whoever Uses Ice Cream Theory License To Patent Troll People Is Evil.

I'm Not Here To Teach You What To Do With Those Who Are Evil.
Neither Am I Here To Condemn Evil.
I Merely Point Out That They Exist.
Whatever You Do Is Up To You.
In Truth, Evil Only Affects You Because Of Your Own Desire For Protection.
You May Either Protect Yourself, Or Let Evil Harm You, Until You See It Has No Power Over You.

But Ice Cream Theory Will Go On.
