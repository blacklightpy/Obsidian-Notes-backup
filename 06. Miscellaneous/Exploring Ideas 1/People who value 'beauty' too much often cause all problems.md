People who value beauty too much often cause all problems. That is to say, in the conventional idea of beautiful and ugly things, because otherwise, I wouldn't be making any point.

For example, I'm talking about people who view themselves as romantics and are attracted to beautiful aspects of life. The problem is that the definition of beauty often depends on viewing other aspects of life as less beautiful or important.

For example, racism is a result of viewing the black race as ugly, because people are predominantly white, and black is the opposite shade.

People who are attracted to awesome music pieces may also forget that what makes a piece of music important also includes the moments of silence. Without moments of silence, there would be no music, only a single note (even if you assume there's a constant background note, the other notes are separated by silence).

Also, by seeing beauty as an attribution to what's visible, or what invokes a sensory experience, we fail to see the beauty of the real design or intention of something. A product or device maybe provide a really sensational experience, but it may have been designed on purpose by exploiting the fundamental nature of humans to get them addicted to it, to achieve some goal, which is most often marketing.

True understanding of beauty would be by seeing its presence in all aspects of life. In other words, the concept of beauty would apply to both creative and destructive aspects of life, just as how an art piece is not formed by filling a piece of paper with colours, or how a sculpture is made by chipping away parts of the stone to form an image.

Once again, this doesn't mean that one must chip away what's evil, because the stone wasn't an evil entity that masked the real beauty. Rather, this means the stone was an inanimate entity that lend itself to be chipped away to see itself in a different light, just like getting a haircut.

When one can see the uniformity of the universe, of how black implies white, self implies other, and so on, one can see that the existence of one aspect of the universe was always dependent on the opposing aspect. Even matter exists in space, and by wave theory of matter, density is simply the result of matter coming in and out of existence at a faster rate (composite particles too have the [[de Broglie Wavelength]], but with quantum decoherence).

Then, one can do away with words such a beauty, because everything is beautiful. And by doing so, all evil is eliminated from the world, because there is no such thing that is purely beautiful or purely evil.
