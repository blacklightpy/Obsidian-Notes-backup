You are looking outdoors, you see a cat. You like it.
After a while, you see a small bird, and you like it.

But you see the cat aiming for the bird when it flies too low, and your perception of the cat changes, because it is about to eat the bird you liked. But when choosing to side with the bird, you forget that the cat is hungry. The cat doesn't eat the bird out of hatred, it eats it for it's survival.

Are we not siding with the hunger of the cat, which we can relate to?
Why is hunger even a thing in nature?

What benefit does hunger even have? Harnessing energy? For this, I wrote: [[Isn't using technology built by atheists wrong for religious people]].
