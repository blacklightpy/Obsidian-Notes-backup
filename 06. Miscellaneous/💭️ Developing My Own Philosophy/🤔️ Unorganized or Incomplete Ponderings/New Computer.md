All "Programs" will have their "Program Definitions".

There will be no compilation steps. The programs will simply be readable from the basics.

All complex functions will be built up from simpler blocks. Efficiency is second to modularity. We are not that resource scarce.

BONUS: Porting all generic assembly programs to new computer programs with an easy one-step conversion layer. That also means operating systems will be entirely converted and apps based on the operating systems will only run on them. Remember, operating systems set privileges.
