On the public relations front, people are used to paying from companies who solve problems and maintain a product. If for example, Obsidian open sources their sync platform, in addition to the fact that they are slightly losing their profits by giving away the official sync service for self-hosting, it also becomes a burden because they will be obliged to maintain any bugs that users report, while they could've lived more freely by not letting users know about the different ways in which the software could be used, which would give them the headache of responsibility to fix any minor issues.
