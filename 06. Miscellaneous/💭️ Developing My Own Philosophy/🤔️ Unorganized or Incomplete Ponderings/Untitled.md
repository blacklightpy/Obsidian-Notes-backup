Think of time as relative cycles instead of as seconds
Think of length as relative metres instead of metres
Think of velocity as relative velocity instead of relative metres per relative cycles

Enjoy life after doing work
Because we must acquire food, like all other beings
If all we do is consume and not contribute, we will fail unless we only eat plants.
