I know momentum is conserved, not acceleration.

But see, if we consider that we have a rocket boots, we can travel at the same acceleration as a ship, and we will feel as though we are floating relative to the ship, as long as the acceleration matches.

Is there any mistake I'm making here, such as external gravitation effects? I'm interested in finding a scope for this.
