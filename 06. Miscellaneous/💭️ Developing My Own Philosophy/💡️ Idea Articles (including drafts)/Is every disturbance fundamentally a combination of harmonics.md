I started this by thinking of this: [[Is audio fundamentally comprised of frequencies]]

- Even considering electromagnetic waves, is it correct for us to consider that every disturbance or sound can be modeled as a combination of harmonics?
- Sure, it is possible, and mathematically valid; however, is it fundamental?
- I think that vibrations are the natural state of an undisturbed field, however, the fields in our universe are not undisturbed.
- That's not to say there can't be an undisturbed universe.
- I think any alive universe should have a prime mover configuration.
