We are like the leaves of a plant.
When we harm another leaf, it is the plant that we are harming.
And that plant is what I call god.

Who created the leaf?
Well, I said the plant is reality.
I could use the model of the dancer in an outfit.
The dancer doing his dance, dressed in an outfit is the creation.
And he himself is the creation.
And we are all parts of his body, moving with the rhythm.
# Ego Satisfying Economy
- In a capitalist economy, the inability of an individual to make money will make miserable the lives of those who are dependent on them. (In traditional fashion, the sins of the father will be paid for by the son)
	- I've used "inability of an individual to make money" instead of "vices", because in capitalism, virtue is not what matters, because love doesn't exist in the battlefield (MGS 2 Reference)
- In a communist economy, the vices of an individual will be paid for by everyone
	- Whether you like it or not, Jesus Christ was communist (except that he said share what you have, instead of seize the means of production. The ends were the same, but the means were different.)
	- This is by nature, unlike capitalism, a system in which love exists (Like Sky: Children of The Light)
# All Vices Originate from Ego, The Lack of Oneness
- Ego exists if we feel like the others are better off than us, which makes us feel lesser and, thus needing to protect our ego from harm, from the cruel world.
- It's almost like a test - it is certain that if the world was fair, everyone would have had an easier time being nice -- but provided that it isn't the case, are you willing to do what's necessary to restore it? -- But it's not entirely a test, because this is something that has to be done at all times -- so it is the nature of existence itself -- because we always need to have thoughtfulness.
# The Goal of Life is Coexistence in Harmony

# Solution to Harmony
- If we consider a system to handle everyone's needs, that will be what politics is
- It is not possible to have complete peace in a secular society, because somewhere, people will disagree -- but that's not to say a particular belief system would be better
- Generally, a peaceful belief system > secular governments > dictatorship
