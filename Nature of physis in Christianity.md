Physis refers to the "nature" of beings in Christianity. That is, as opposed to "nous", meaning essence.

People have argued about how many natures Jesus had, and whether the personal form of Jesus had multiple natures, and whether they were united or separated, or absorbed.

To a person who is not trying too hard, this seems like meaningless hoola-hoop jumps.

I have to ask - what is this "nature"?

Well, of course everyone can "feel" some super-natural differences. That is, not necessarily "out of the world", but more like an abstract sense of some experience that is commonly felt, but not something one talks about enough, or knows well enough to talk about, because everyone who follows different lifestyles feels it at different points in their life, and in different ways. So only if everyone were brought to one order could they "talk" about it, and that's exactly what Christianity did.

But when we skip the process of digging deep into the differences and try to pigeonhole everything into a single idea of a "nature", by rejecting the ideas of others who too were trying their best, and by issuing anathemas, we lose a lot of its essence. Sure, it may work well for the first group of people who chose it, just like a shirt would fit for like-minded people. But over time, people of different minds and experiences will arise, and they would want different shirts, and these shirts would not be a good fit for them, however much they may try to fit into the old shirts.

Now when it comes to shirts, one can have a good classification of all the sizes very easily, and can make a dogma out of it. But when it comes to the mind, people do not have a perfect knowledge of it, and therefore, they couldn't make a perfect dogma to contain it, and the same went for science. This infinitely complex nature of reality is what provides clear paths to break free of dogmas.
