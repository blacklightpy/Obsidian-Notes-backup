Physis refers to the "nature" of beings in Christianity. That is, as opposed to "nous", meaning essence.

### Problem

People have argued about how many natures Jesus had, and whether the personal form of Jesus had multiple natures, and whether they were united or separated, or absorbed.

To a person who is not trying too hard, this seems like meaningless hoola-hoop jumps.

### Wondering

**I have to ask - what is this "nature"?**

Well, of course everyone can "feel" some super-natural differences. That is, not necessarily "out of the world", but more like an abstract sense of some experience that is commonly felt, but not something one talks about enough, or knows well enough to talk about, because everyone who follows different lifestyles feels it at different points in their life, and in different ways. So only if everyone were brought to one order could they "talk" about it, and that's exactly what Christianity did.

But when we skip the process of digging deep into the differences and try to pigeonhole everything into a single idea of a "nature", by rejecting the ideas of others who too were trying their best, and by issuing anathemas, we lose a lot of its essence. Sure, it may work well for the first group of people who chose it, just like a shirt would fit for like-minded people. But over time, people of different minds and experiences will arise, and they would want different shirts, and these shirts would not be a good fit for them, however much they may try to fit into the old shirts.

Now when it comes to shirts, one can have a good classification of all the sizes very easily, and can make a dogma out of it. But when it comes to the mind, people do not have a perfect knowledge of it, and therefore, they couldn't make a perfect dogma to contain it, and the same went for science. This infinitely complex nature of reality is what provides clear paths to break free of dogmas.

## My religious thinking 
#rough 

In my opinion, these are the natures:
- Ultimate Nature: consciousness
- Ontological Nature: creator, creation
- Detailed Nature:
	- Creator:
		- God (Form)
		- Power (Ability)
		- Incarnation (Form)
	- Creation:
		- Field (Form)
		- Energy (Ability)
		- Matter (Form)
		- Consiousness (Ability)
- States of Consciousness
	- Inert (When there is no body to conduct energy to a state of awareness)
	- Living (When the body can conduct energy as signals just enough to be aware)
	- Aware (When you condition your body to conduct energy well to be fully aware)
- Concepts
	- Free Will / [Consciousness]
	- Manifestation of the World / [Creation of Field]
	- Cosmological Evolution / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Biological Evolution / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Life / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Awareness / [Conditioning of Energy and Matter] (Knowledge included)
	- Sleep / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Death / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Karma (questioning)
	- Salvation from Crisis / [Divine Intervention / Awareness]
	- Devotion to God / [Conditioning of Energy and Matter by Divine Intervention]
- Faculties for Divine Intervention
	- Personal Soul (the energy in the material brain)
	- Divine Soul (the aspect of the immaterial God)
- Faculties for Awareness
	- Conditioning of the Body (or else, energy won't flow to be aware)

### Spirituality
The material is spiritual. There is nothing external.
Even divine intervention requires the material form, that is why God only interacts as incarnate.
The creation is the material form, the creator is the immaterial form.

Brahmaan is both material and non-material. All opposites.
### Energies of Nature
Energies: Tamas (Self Harm), Sattva (Stable), Rajas (Ego)

### Free Will
God set the initial Karma, to create the world.
Life forms through their free will can do personal Karma, but God will intervene to help.
As one grows and takes more free will, God intervenes less, unless the life form seeks God.

### Free Will's Role on Natural Energies
Energies are states of the body. Free will can exert actions to change the energy.
Both free will and the body that is works are the same entity.
However, free will is formless, and the body is formal.

Awareness can help provide more free will into our actions.
But certain actions take you farther from awareness.
e.g. Masturbation requires you to give up your state of awareness.
Then it makes your body so tired as to not achieve the state of awareness.
Unless you can get back to the state of awareness quickly.

This is even more so the case when one identifies with the material world.
They won't remember to switch to the state of awareness and would instead go farther from it.
So one should not go to sleep after it, unless it is sleep time.

Also, although one can stay awake in this manner, not all of the body is the conscious part and needs maintenance.
So one must go to sleep timely.

### Role of Intelligence in Turbulence of the Mind
All other life forms and God are aware, it's just the intelligent life forms that make mistakes.

### Significance of the Current World
The world doesn't disappear, because you, the person is Brahmaan as a life form.
To change your current body and live elsewhere would mean destroying your body.
Because all bodies there are have the same consciousness, of Brahmaan.
So one just has to come to terms with their current body.

This world will change when it is it's time.
### About Mind Reading
Brahmaan cannot read minds because minds are a dualistic illusion.
That is, when you write letters on a piece of paper with ink, you see information.
Brahmaan however sees all ink, all paper and all information, so the dualistic appearance is not of relevance.

What about why this world is structured? Isn't such a structure ultimately relevant?
No, it wouldn't be, because this one one of several such arbitrary structures.
In another sense, Brahmaan is wise, rather than all knowing, because it's too all knowing.
That is, when we have a lot of knowledge, tiny observations become less relevant.
Brahmaan would know every memory that everyone has at every time.
However, that level of knowledge is not useful in the dualistic world, unless one can focus in on it.

Can one focus enough to get this information from the state of pure awareness?
That is, it is easier to get universal knowledge than to get knowledge about a specific entity.

The thing to note here is that even though the data is in Brahmaan, the act of focusing sees it through the lens of Maaya.
That is, you would be using the realization of Brahmaan to look into Maaya again.
So, it may be possible, but the method of focusing would be more difficult than attaining universal knowledge.
In my experience, attaining universal knowledge was possible, but very difficult.

Also, I'm not sure if knowing alone can help you achieve anything, as it would be similar to spying.
That is, unless you know your fate and paths to take too.
But doing so breaks the point of the illusion, and there is no fun in that.

You want experiences to come about by Karma, not by data analysis.
You want someone to love you for who you are, not because you spied their interests.

Even if it is possible, it will only be gained at the cost of pain.
So it is best not to look into it, unless you've been given that in your life.

### Nature of Creation
Everything is already created, you just have to experience it.
That is, you cannot create like Eeshvara, because you have already created everything to perfection.

Every intervention is created as well, it's a matter of which choices you play out.

### Awareness of Brahmaan
Is Brahmaan all knowing, or is it too everything to be all knowing?

Well, I'd say whatever it is, it is not important for us to know that information within Maaya.

Whenever we want to know something, we can tap into that state of consciousness.

Putting it into words, in a good fashion, will take a lot of effort.

### Relation to Science

Brahmaan is the unified field.

W and Z bosons were in the electroweak epoch, and that's because weak forces act on a more deeper scale than the more available electromagnetic and gravitational forces.

### What is the source of knowledge and why didn't Indians make technology?

The source of knowledge is simply the Brahmaan consciousness.

From that, one could know about ideas like how wind would flow.

But to tabulate them into words, would take a lot of time in the worldly format, and it would require comm
