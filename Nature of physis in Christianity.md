Physis refers to the "nature" of beings in Christianity. That is, as opposed to "nous", meaning essence.

### Problem

People have argued about how many natures Jesus had, and whether the personal form of Jesus had multiple natures, and whether they were united or separated, or absorbed.

To a person who is not trying too hard, this seems like meaningless hoola-hoop jumps.

### Wondering

**I have to ask - what is this "nature"?**

Well, of course everyone can "feel" some super-natural differences. That is, not necessarily "out of the world", but more like an abstract sense of some experience that is commonly felt, but not something one talks about enough, or knows well enough to talk about, because everyone who follows different lifestyles feels it at different points in their life, and in different ways. So only if everyone were brought to one order could they "talk" about it, and that's exactly what Christianity did.

But when we skip the process of digging deep into the differences and try to pigeonhole everything into a single idea of a "nature", by rejecting the ideas of others who too were trying their best, and by issuing anathemas, we lose a lot of its essence. Sure, it may work well for the first group of people who chose it, just like a shirt would fit for like-minded people. But over time, people of different minds and experiences will arise, and they would want different shirts, and these shirts would not be a good fit for them, however much they may try to fit into the old shirts.

Now when it comes to shirts, one can have a good classification of all the sizes very easily, and can make a dogma out of it. But when it comes to the mind, people do not have a perfect knowledge of it, and therefore, they couldn't make a perfect dogma to contain it, and the same went for science. This infinitely complex nature of reality is what provides clear paths to break free of dogmas.

In my opinion, these are the natures:
- Ultimate Nature: consciousness
- Ontological Nature: creator, creation
- Detailed Nature:
	- Creator:
		- God (Form)
		- Power (Ability)
		- Incarnation (Form)
	- Creation:
		- Field (Form)
		- Energy (Ability)
		- Matter (Form)
		- Consiousness (Ability)
- States of Consciousness
	- Inert (When there is no body to conduct energy to a state of awareness)
	- Living (When the body can conduct energy as signals just enough to be aware)
	- Aware (When you condition your body to conduct energy well to be fully aware)
- Concepts
	- Free Will / [Consciousness]
	- Creation / [Creation of Field]
	- Cosmological Evolution / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Biological Evolution / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Life / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Awareness / [Conditioning of Energy and Matter]
	- Death / [Transformation of Energy and Matter]
	- Karma (questioning)
	- Salvation from Crisis / [Divine Intervention / Awareness]
	- Devotion to God / [Conditioning of Energy and Matter by Divine Intervention]
- Faculties for Divine Intervention
	- Personal Soul (the energy in the material brain)
	- Divine Soul (the aspect of the immaterial God)
- Faculties for Awareness
	- Conditioning of the Body (or else, energy won't flow to be aware)
