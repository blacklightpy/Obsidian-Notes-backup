Physis refers to the "nature" of beings in Christianity. That is, as opposed to "nous", meaning essence.

People have argued about how many natures Jesus had, and whether the personal form of Jesus had multiple natures, and whether they were united or separated, or absorbed.

To a person who is not trying too hard, this seems like meaningless hoola-hoop jumps.

I have to ask - what is this "nature"?
