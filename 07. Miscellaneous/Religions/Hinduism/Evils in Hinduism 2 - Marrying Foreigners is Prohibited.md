No, the Dharma Shastras explicitly forbid Hindus from marrying foreigners, otherwise known as _[Mlecchas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mleccha)_.

Here are some verses from the _Atri Smriti_ that prohibit interracial marriages:

> 182. The purification for knowing [having sex with] a _Mleccha_ woman consists in a Santapanam penance, or it is said, one may attain to purification by performing a Taptakrcchra penance.
> 183. If a person lives with a wife known [who has had sex with] by a _Mleccha_ man, he becomes purified by bathing with the cloth on and drinking clarified butter.
> 184. By cohabiting [living with and having sex with], unknowingly, with the women of the _Chandalas_, _Mlecchas_ ... one is purified by a Paraka.
> 185. **But if one knows them willingly, and procreates children with them, then he is degraded to the same caste as them**; there is no doubt about it, for that man is born as her son.

So it is actually a huge sin to marry foreigners, since one becomes degraded to the caste of _Mleccha_.
