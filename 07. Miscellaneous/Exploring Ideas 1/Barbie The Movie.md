I saw a part of Ben Shapiro's review on it. I haven't really seen many movies since 2019.

He says, the core message is:
- Matriarchy is good, patriarchy is bad
- The only way to escape patriarchy is to hate men

I'm not usually a fan of Ben as he's conservative and I disagree with him a lot, but I believe Barbie movie could potentially be used as a movement to separate men and women in the name of feminism. If it is about rights, any means to do it is fair, right?

I believe feminism is important in that women need to be free of the fixed rules placed on them, and it has nothing to do with hating the other gender. It's certainly not all men who are responsible for this, but that's the reasoning used here.

"Skewed feminism" isn't much different from "skewed counter-terrorism" or "skewed national security" or "skewed Islamic jihad" (a spiritual war) or "skewed Christianity" (people can confess so they can do whatever they want) .

But I should really watch the movie myself before judging it. I'm only presenting my concerns here.
