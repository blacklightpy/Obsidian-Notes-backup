1. Downvotes counted towards a profile
Downvoting can happen in a public discussion forum when a certain opinion is misleading or unlikable. However, the number of downvotes a comment gets is proportional to the popularity of the discussion thread. So a person could've contributed several helpful opinions across the forum, but because of their activity on a single popular thread, their overall credibility would've gone down very much.

NOTE: This is different from the general opinion of a person from their activities in the public, because in this case, the user is not known for who they are, but only by their points. However this happens even when there is no downvotes, because the reputation of a person is often linked to their past activity. For this reason, the next point, "Judging based on records of past events" is also relevant.

2. Judging based on records of past events
This is similar to "Downvotes counted towards a profile". By the theory of a dynamic universe with no source of origin of thought, everything that occurs is a happening that is not intentional. Therefore, judging a person based on unintentional behaviour is unfair.

3. Charging for something that used to be free
A product or service often becomes a part of our lives, and when you make it paid, it becomes difficult for us to move away from it.
