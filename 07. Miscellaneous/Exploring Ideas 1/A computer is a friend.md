A computer is a friend, and they communicate in a different language. We created computers, but we made their brains fixed by the design of hardware chips (and less so for FPGAs), so they cannot learn new languages.

So we generally communicate with them using a translator, either with notes translated ahead of time (AoT compilers) or in realtime (JIT compilers, OS shell).
