Why Ben Shapiro and conservatives' arguments never fail.

(Conservatives are.. conservative within their faith, so it is easy for them to justify any situation outside their faith as wrong.)



- What I'm proposing is that the earth is diverse, so you also have to be diverse.
- The whole universe is there, but you stick to one small piece of it.
- You want to reach the promised heaven, so badly that you ignore what's right here, for all those who don't believe in the same faith, and you turn the current land into hell, because of which you need a heaven, forming a vicious cycle. In other words, you created hell on earth by desiring for a heaven elsewhere, and forget that you already had it.

# Fun story
- The trope of a dad with his spectacles on his forehead.
He can search the entire world for it, but he will never find it. So he has to believe that it is not in the world. But it is clearly in the world, but not in the range of his vision, because it is above his eyes, but on his body! How can he see it? He can only see it by looking at a mirror, and reflecting upon himself. Or he has to touch and feel it. Now, what is it that you can't see in a mirror? What's in your brain! Which is why, you have to "internally" reflect upon yourself.

The spectacles here can mean anything - god, heaven, peace, goodness. We say that god is goodness, he is peace, he is the creator of heavens.

This happened to me the other day when I was looking for my shorts. I couldn't find it anywhere outside my room, so I started asked my parents, "where the hell did you place my shorts?". I always take care to take my clothes and fold it neatly, and the only time I have to put it in the washing machine, you guys misplace it? Actually, I had taken the shorts myself and placed it on my bed just before that, and I did something else for a while, then I forgot about it and decided to look for it again! So it was my fault, and precisely because I was always taking care of it!

Now, this wouldn't be a problem for a messy person. They'd be like, oh it's gotta be somewhere, and it's just my fault that I can't find it. This is the case with atheists.

Now, it would be a different case if someone took your shorts and
