# How to use this
Find a question (or answer). Read the first answer (or question) to it, and then collapse it to look for any secondary answers (or questions) to the same question (or answer).

**Edits to make:**
- Each question could just be it's own question, instead of being chained.
	- For example, Q>A>Link to next Question.
- The chains of questions, since this is religion, is likely to make a circular web. This is speculation, of course, let's see.
- **Note:** Questions could have been unordered and ID referenced, but I'll instead go with a sequence, just because I prefer it
	- I could try creating a link and see it's graph by using a separate vault though
		- Vault 1: Questions in separate files
		- Vault 2: Questions and Answers in separate files
- Try philosophizing the principles of religion too

- Counter: Question 26
## 21. Again, because of the desires we're given, we are bound to make the same mistakes again and again due. Even if we wish to eliminate them, they always return, because that's the way we are made. Is it not unfair to create us in that manner?
## 22. Why would an infinite god's justification be to make someone suffer to prepare them for something bigger, when he could've just prepared them in an instant?

## 25. Is it not a slave kingdom?

## 26. Why would he not just let us have them peacefully in this world without all the side-effects?
**(Anyways, theoretically, all desires do have to be balanced or else we will lose interest in them. This leads me to believe heaven is just an illusion, like a mirage, that even god would consider pointless. It is no different from a drug that will give a temporary high that you can never reach again, leading you into an endless addiction, because first time's the charm.)**

### It was to test us

## 28. Ask why would a god create a devil separately to foil his own plans? If the devil was a cast out, why couldn't he just have burned him without letting him cause problems for others?
