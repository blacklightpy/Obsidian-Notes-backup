> _Jihad_ is mentioned in four places in the Qur'an as a noun, while its derived verb is used in twenty-four places. _Mujahid_, the active participle meaning "jihadist", is mentioned in two verses. In some of these mentions (see At-Tawbah 9/41, 44, 81, 86), it is understood that the word _jihad_ directly refers to war, and in others, _jihad_ is used in the sense of "the effort to live in accordance with Allah's will".

>- Jihad by the sword _(jihad bis saif)_ refers to _qital fi sabilillah_ (armed fighting in the way of God, or holy war), the most common usage by Salafi Muslims and offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Meanwhile, the Islamic Golden Age saw the origin of a specific Hadith that's more rational:

> A related hadith tradition that has "found its way into popular Muslim literature", and which has been said to "embody the Muslim mindset" of the Islamic Golden Age "Abbasid Caliphate") (the period from the mid-8th century to mid-13th century following the relocation of the Abbasid capital from Damascus to Baghdad), is:
