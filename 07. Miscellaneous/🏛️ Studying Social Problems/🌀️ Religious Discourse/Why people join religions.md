	- This clip shows a woman explaining why she joined Islam
	- She quoted a verse that said the life of this world is meaningless
	- She said she was seeking god in all the wrong places, such as seeking likes and followers, and posting fitness modelling.
		- I totally don't understand what she was thinking.
		- She mentions "fitness modelling" just like that she was, on purpose sexually projecting herself in the name of feminist freedom, and expecting it to be what's the right way of life.
		- I'm not saying in the slightest manner that fitness modelling is bad. Not even in the slightest. I'm saying that people do other things in the name of things that are acceptable.
		- What is the difference between a woman walking naked in the streets in the name of her freedom, and a woman posting lewd photos of herself on the internet with the intention



All your actions are guided by your intentions. Don't worry if your actions don't represent your intentions and if people misunderstand you. In the larger picture, the sum of your actions will manifest as the result of your intentions.

What's the difference between (TODO: Complete the sentence and post)
- A woman walking naked because she believes it's
- A woman walking naked with the intention of ..., because she believes ..., and she can justify it using ...,
The intention!

It is said that sexualizing is a "nuanced" topic. It says that sexualization isn't bad, but it's when it's without consent it is problematic.

However, what is one supposed to infer from this? Is one supposed to ask the woman whether they can sexualize her? That seems problematic and really terrible to me.

The people who say "sexualization with consent" is okay have a problem with religions that prohibit sexualization, but also with sexualization itself outside the context of consent. The problem I see with this is that, as we can see, it is more complicated. It literally also means that consent varies from person to person.

One way of explanation I've seen is called F.R.I.E.S.
- Freely Given
- Retractable
- Informed
- Enthusiastic
- Specific

How do you know which one is it?
That's the thing, you do not know

What do you do in such a scenario?
- You impose your religious law on them ❎
- You judge them according to how you feel ❎ (because feelings are not always right)
- You do not judge, and accept that there are such people in the world ✅
