- One State proposal
	- Isratine
		- Both for and against group believe that Isratine will have equal rights for all citizens without regard for religion or ethnicity. But it is for the same reason that most of them believe it's unthinkable.
		- A multi-poll option by Near East Consulting (NEC) in Nov 2007 noted that "one-state proposal" got less votes than either "two-state" or "a Palestinian state on all historical Palestine".
		- A poll by NEC in Feb 2007 also found that 70% of Palestinians backed it when given a straight choice as supporting or opposing "a one-state solution in historic Palestine where Muslims, Christians and Jews have equal rights and responsibilities".
		- Both parties oppose it claiming it would destroy the rights of both societies and would end up in self-determinism.
		- Against
			- Among Israelites
				- It is opposed by both the Arab and Jewish left, because they argue that the current West Bank settlement is creating a situation where either Israel and West Bank will turn into an apartheid state with full civil rights for Israeli Arabs and Jews, with limited autonomy for Palestinian Arabs, just like how it is currently practiced under the Palestinian authority; or it will turn into a bi-national state which will no longer be a Zionist national home for the Jewish people.
				- A large majority of Israeli Arabs oppose any political solution that would reduce their status as purely Israeli Arabs because they enjoy better life in Israel than in Palestine
				- They argue that it would erode the notion of Israel as a Jewish state. The demographic trends show that the west of Jordan river would have an Arab majority population, and they are afraid that Palestinians would constitute an electoral majority, which would pose a threat to the very premise of Israel, explicitly created as a Jewish state in response to the Holocaust. A 2000 poll shortly after the outbreak of the second Intifada showed 18% of Israeli Jews supporting a bi-national state.
			- Among Palestinians
				- Similar arguments like Israeli left are used, and they stress that the time to implement a two-state solution is running out as the West Bank settlements increase
				- It is opposed by Islamists who think it goes against the idea of an Islamic state
				- It is opposed by Arab nationalists who think it goes against the idea of pan-Arabism
	- "one-state reality" is a term that means in the current situation in Israel and Palestine is de-facto one state 
- Two State proposal
	- Against
		- In 2014, 60% of all Palestinians said their final goal of their national movement should be "to work towards reclaiming all of historic Palestine from the river to the sea".
			- Civic figures say it calls for a single state with people of all religions having equal citizenship
			- Islamic scholars say that Mahdi - a redemptive apocalyptic figure central to Islamic 
- Two State solution with pre-1967 Borders
	- I'm not aware of other resolutions, but here's one I got from Wikipedia.
	- In 2019, UN General assembly adopted 5 resolutions, urging states to refuse changes to pre-1967 borders ([[Israel-Palestine Peace Ideas#^main-source|Source]])
		- #### Document Nomenclature
			- Guide: https://research.un.org/en/docs
		- #### The Resolutions
			- 1. Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine (A/17/L.15)
				- won by 147 in favour, 7 against (Australia, Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, US), with 13 abstentions
				- Lasting peace in Israel, and an end to Israeli occupation, while calling on Israel, the occupying power to comply strictly with international law, cease actions aimed at altering the demographics and immediately halt any settlement activities
			- 2. The Syrian Golan (A/74/L.9)
				- won by 91 in favour, 9 against (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, United Kingdom, United States),  with 65 Abstentions
				- Israeli decision to impose its law in Golan Heights is "null and void", and demands withdrawal
			- 3. UN also adopted 3 resolutions dealing with UN Committee system's own support to Palestinian people
				- 3.1. Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (A/74/L.14)
					- Requests the UN committee to exert all efforts to support the right to self-determination of Palestinian people and to support the achievement of an end Israeli occupation

					- Requests the Department of Global Communications to disseminate information on the activities of the UN system relating to the question of Palestine and peace efforts.
		- #### Response
			- The Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine said that:
				- International support for the Palestinian people has not wavered despite Israel's attempts to destroy a two-state formula, and recent aberrations by US Administration that contradict international law.
				- Failure to hold Israel accountable for its crimes has led it to believe it is a State above the law. 
				- As a result, the UNs Charter and UN resolutions are being trampled with utter contempt.
				- Palestinian civilians, including women and children, continue to be killed and injured.
				- Israel’s 12-year blockade of Gaza has caused 2 million Palestinians to live in an “open-air prison,” where the unemployment rate is a staggering 53 per cent.
			- The representative of Israel, voicing opposition to the 5 resolutions said that:
				- The international community has fully embraced the Palestinian perspective and thereby stands in the way of ending the conflict by encouraging Palestinians to refuse any proposed solution.
				- Though the Jewish people have a biblical and historic right to the entire land, Israel accepted the partition plan in the spirit of compromise. The Arab leadership, by contrast, chose war. During the twentieth century an estimated 850,000 Jews were forced out of Arab countries and became refugees but were ignored by the international community because it didn’t serve the Palestinian narrative.
				- Accepting the Palestinian Authority’s stated policy of glorifying terrorism against Jews and condemning Jews for living in Jerusalem is counterproductive to peace, he said, calling the international community morally bankrupt.
			- The representative of the US echoed Israel's sentiments that the resolutions are biased against Israel, adding that such a one-sided approach undermines trust.
			- #### Right to Reply
				- The representative of Iran, responding to the representative of Israel, said:
					- That country uses fallacies as tools to divert attention from its expansionist policies and brutalities.
					- As such, these fallacies constitute weapons of mass deception.
					- The Israeli regime is famous for its atrocities, apartheid policies and well-documented war crimes, he said, adding that it has a long history of following opportunistic policies to divert attention from its own savage actions against innocent Palestinians.
					- Israel is the only regime openly practicing racism, having recently legalized it, he said, stressing that Israel’s occupation and racism lie at the heart of all conflicts in the Middle East.
