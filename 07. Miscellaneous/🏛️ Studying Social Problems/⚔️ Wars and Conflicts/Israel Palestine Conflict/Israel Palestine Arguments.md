###### Why won't Jordan or Egypt take Palestinian refugees from Gaza?
Because once 2.3 million people move to other countries and live in refugee camps, for example in Sinai, it will then result in chaos and unrest, and it'll give more room for Western media to say - look how the Arabs are fighting each other, and it's good that Israel got rid of them.

Then they will go to West Bank and move them to Jordan.

Why won't all the 44 European countries take Israelites if they have nowhere else to go? Why won't USA with their 50 states give them a state? They're always complaining about Florida.

Same reason.

They want to paint the idea that all Arabs are the same. Then Israel can just Invade Jordan and ask why can't Saudi Arabia take Jordan refugees?
