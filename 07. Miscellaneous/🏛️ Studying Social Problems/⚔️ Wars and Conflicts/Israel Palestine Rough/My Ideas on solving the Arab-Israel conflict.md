>NOTE: This solution was tried already - as the Jewish state solution, which they did not want.

Arab nationalism could also lead to Shariah law.
Religion should stay out of politics.
Nevertheless, if the countries wish to implement the law among themselves, they can by consensus, without forcing it on other states.

**The ideologies are Arab nationalism, Islamism, pan-Arabism and pan-Islamism**
- Arab nationalism: A nation for the Arabs (more secular)
- Islamism: A nation with the Islamic way of life and politics
- pan-Arabism: A unified nation for all the Arabs (more secular)
- pan-Islamism: A unified nation for all the Arabs with the Islamic way of life and politics.

**Islamic states mean many things, we have:**
- Fully Islamic law
- Partly Islamic law
- Islam as state religion, but not law
- Islamic monarchies
- Islamic republics

Examples:
- Arabs are just the Arab speaking nations
- Turks, Persians, North African Berbers are all Muslims, but not Arab

> [!NOTE] **These are the properties of an Islamic state:**
>The guiding principles of an Islamic government is the concept of Al-Shura. The general consensus is that it should have the following:
>- Meeting or consultation that follows the teachings of Islam.
>- Consultation following the guidelines of the Quran and the Sunnah. (Hence Shariah law)
>- There is a leader elected among them to head the meeting.
>- The discussion should be based on _mushawarah_ and _mudhakarah_.
>- All members are given fair opportunity to voice out their opinions.
>- The issue should be of _maslahah ammah_ or public interest.
>- The voices of the majority are accepted, provided it does not violate the teachings of the Quran or Sunnah.

# Thinking about it
- A bi-national state would violate both Arab nationalism and Islamism.
- But single Arab nation with a recognition for the historic value of the land for the Jewish people will be in line with pan-Arabism, but not Islamism.
- A single Arab nation with a recognition for the historic value of the land, as well Islamic law in all other jurisdictions will be in line with pan-Islamism


- In essence, Israel will be a Jewish-flavoured state which is a part of the Arab national state.
- How about borders? Well, the border will have to be diffused, as instead of having solid boundaries.
- If there need be boundaries, i.e. if people are not ready to see differences in regions without demarcated boundaries, the current state of Israel, Palestine and Jordan can be merged together to be called by both names Palestine and Israel, like we call India Hindustan and Bharat. It will be fair because that is the spot where Abrahamic religions originated, so 

- It cannot be a Shariah law, because the non-believers must also have their freedoms and rights secured.

Israel, Palestine and Jordan can be called the land of Palestine.
Due to historic reasons, the land of Israel is considered nostalgic by the Jews.
If it has to be called Zion, it's a hardwired attachment to the place. But rather, it can be just called Israel.

The entire union of Arab countries, with the inclusion of Israel, can be considered a pan-Arab state.
But with Israel being a special state whose laws are exempt from the general Arab laws, as it is a holy site for the Jewish people.



Now, Egypt has built it's own infrastructure, and countries will be disinterested in sharing their wealth.
But it's ok, Gaza and West Bank can enter a reconstruction period, funded by UN and Israel.

- As for the feasibility of pan-Arabism or pan-Islamism, it has to do with the national politics of other Arab nations, and they have to solve it politically among themselves. Some countries like Saudi Arabia for example are more restrictive, while others aren't so restrictive.
