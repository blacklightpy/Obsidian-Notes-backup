Terrorism is a loaded word.
Terrorism = Terror + ism, which is to say, the spreading of terror, or frightening people.

It can mean any "morally wrong" act. In a general sense, it is the use of intentional violence and fear to achieve political or ideological aims.

Governments and non-state groups often use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups.

We can define terrorism as the intentional use of violence during peacetime, or during war against non-combatants.

The UN General Assembly definition is:

> Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.

## Examples
Islamic terrorism is the most common form of terrorism nowadays. This has nothing to do with Islam, I would say. Islamic is a religion, much like every other religion. Now, religions are supposed to grant people a deep sense of meaning into the meaning of their lives, and Islam does a very good job at this. Because of this reason, people interpreted the religion very strictly to preserve it's 'purity', and Wahhabism is one such school of thought. al-Wahab interpreted that the original practices of the first three generations of Muslims, or salfs should be followed by all Muslims, which led to "salafism". Jihadism means fighting in the name of Allah, which was a slogan used by Muslims during their periods of battle against the oppressing tribes of Mecca. 

Some salafists combined both and interpreted any deviation from salafism as a threat to Islam, and started violent jihad against such Muslim sects. And some other groups also took this one step further and decided that Islam should be spread to other parts of the world as a goal. And some others combine Salafist Jihadism with Islamic nationalism.
