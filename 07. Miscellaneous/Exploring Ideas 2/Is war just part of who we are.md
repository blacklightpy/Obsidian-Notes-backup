Can infinite resources solve war?

In a way of thinking:
- War movies are entertaining (related idea: sex sells)
- Without war there will be no war movies
- Hence there will be war

So without war, we may invent artificial scarcity to create war.
# If that is the case

- We love it when good triumphs over bad
- So we will create bad from good, just so we can defeat it
- The capitalists love to create this illusion to sell and profit
- Then the capitalist becomes the sustainer of the world
- They do it so they can profit selfishly while misleading others
- Is ego the reason for our existence?
- All because we are driven to feed our egoistic desires?

- Peace is achieved when there are no vices
- But without vices, will existence be meaningless?
# The critical question
- It was said by Andrew Collier that
> "to look at people in capitalist society and conclude that human nature is egoism, is like looking at people in a factory where pollution is destroying their lungs and saying that it is human nature to cough."

- However, my question is whether we love the pollution
- That is, given enough peace, will we get tired of it and choose war?

# A more meaningful way of thinking
- Maybe it's just the nature of life, a desire to break equilibrium.
- As Erwin Schrodinger put it:
> Living things avoid decay into disorder and equilibrium
- Maybe humans just always need to be changing
- The easiest change that can be made in a world with physics is a destructive change
- When things are bad, they strive to reach the equilibrium
- When things are good, they strive to change the equilibrium
- But since it is to satisfy life, they choose not to destroy themselves
- In which case they choose to destroy others

If we understand how others are part of our own existence, we will able to exit this behaviour
## A helpful analogy
I found a helpful analogy to understand Schrodinger's quote from ["Life, Explored" by Archit Bhardwaj | Predict | Medium](https://medium.com/predict/what-is-life-4629c6ba1c2a):
> Let’s pretend that your download folder is the universe; It started orderly and got more chaotic over time. By investing energy, you can clean it up — this is what living things do.

- So life is like cleaning up after the activities we do.
- So we have until the end of a day to set things right for the day
- If we do more than what we can set right for the day, it will become a backlog

In other words, "a stitch in time saves nine".

- Huge mistakes by other people will be a problem we need to solve together
- But we can do it if we understand them to be part of our own selves
