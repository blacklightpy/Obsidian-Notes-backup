The Jews were oppressed all throughout history, because of their faith. The Babylonians and the Romans attacked their lands, but they preserved their identity. The Christians tossed them around throughout Europe and deprived them of equal rights. The Muslims did not really attack the Jews for being different, but they still thought they were stupid, and the attacks were due to violation of peaceful treaties. Jews and Arabs went along fairly well whenever peace treaties were followed, and they didn't have to follow Islam. Muslims paid Zakaat and Jews paid Jizya as taxes, so they both went along fairly well. Later on Muslims only became less secular due to threats from non-Muslims such as Europeans.

Jews are still very scared of the rise of Antisemitism.

> [!NOTE] Regarding Muhammadian Taxes
> 
> Zakaat was given to the poor, but Jizya was given to the state. The definition wasn't clear in the Quran, so they used Hadith for it. Even poor people had to pay Jizya, but sick and disabled people, etc. didn't have to. But the point was, Jizya was still better than forced conversion or extermination as happened in Europe. Well, this is just normal tax collected in every state.
> 
> Nowadays, it's the same tax, but Zakaat still remains the offering of the Muslims in the name of Allah, which others just pay it to the state.

> Non-Muslims didn't have to fight for Muslim religious wars. So this tax was held to support those who protected them.

> > Muslims also have to pay a yearly tax called Zakat. Zakat is even binding on property and jewellery. Zakat should also be paid in the form of food as well. The Jizya is not binding on the property of the Christians and Jews.

> - Social (Jew as socially inferior, "pushy", vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),

> - Cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

> Lehi was a Zionist organization established in 1940, who referred to its members as terrorists. They wanted to get rid of British occupation and establish a Jewish state. Upon establishment of Israel, they disbanded and formed the IDF.

> [!NOTE] History of Antisemitism
> ## Pre-Christian Roman Empire
> - Tiberius forbade Judaism in Rome
> - After the Jewish Roman wars, Hadrian renamed Judea to Syria Palaestina and Jerusalem to Aelia Capitolina to erase the history of the Jewish religion
> - After 70, Jews and Jewish proselytes were only allowed to practice their religion if they paid the Jewish Tax
> - After 135, they were banned from entering Aelia Capitolina except for the day of Tisha B'Av
> ## Rise of Christianity in Roman Empire
> - Until Constantine's time, for a while Christians were persecuted more for trying to start a new religion, and for their criticism of the Gods that the Romans believed to have blessed their city, stating "all the gods of the heathens are devils."
> - Christians, unlike Jews didn't contain themselves to a single state, and wanted to convert other people
> - 137 AD: Christians started blaming all Jews for all time, for deicide of Jesus
> - Christianity became to official religion of Rome
> - 438 AD: Codex Theodosianus barred Jews from civil service, army and legal profession. Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts were restricted. Synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could only be repaired if they were in the danger of collapsing. Synagogues either fell into ruin, were destroyed, or converted to churches.
> ## Rise of Islam
> - The series of conflicts addressed in the Quran - with Banu Nadir, Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Qurayza
> - 628 AD: After the Battle of Trench, there were still some conflicts, most notable being the Battle of Khaybar. The Banu Nadir members, who claimed to be the descendants of Aaron, moved to Khaybar after their expulsion from Medina city in 625. There they had firearms and weapons, and were plotting to attack the Muslims again.
> - After the conflict, they remained peacefully in the Oasis, but later the Caliph Umar expelled them in 642 AD to the newly conquered regions of Syria and Iraq, claiming that Mohammed before his death said that the two religions cannot exist together in the Hejaz.
> ## Protection and Persecution under Islam
> - From the 9th century onwards, the medieval Islamic world imposed "dhimmi" or "protected" status on Christian and Jewish minorities. Nevertheless, Jews were granted more freedom to practise their religion in the Muslim world than they were in Christian Europe.
> - Jewish communities in Spain thrived under tolerant Muslim rule during the Spanish Golden Age and Cordova became a centre of Jewish culture.
> - This period was called golden age of Jewish culture in Spain, and it started from the Muslim conquest of Iberia in 711 by the Ummayad Caliphate, and further in 912, during the rule of Abd al-Rahman II and the establishment of the Caliphate of Cordova.
> - All the following incidents were under the Almoravid Dynasty / Almohad Caliphate in North Africa
> 	- When Almoravids entered North Africa, they started pogroms against the Jews of Cordova in 1011 and Granada massacre in 1066. Later by 1147 they formed the Almohad Caliphate formed and started treating the dhimmis harshly.
> 	- Faced with death or conversion, many fled. Some went to more tolerant Muslim nations, while others went northward to growing Christian kingdoms.
> 	- Destruction of Synagogues were ordered in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Yemen in the Middle Ages.
> 	- 6,000 Jews were killed by a Muslim mob during the 1033 Fez (Morocco) massacre.
> 	- Massacres in Marrakesh (Morocco) in 1146 and 1232
> - In 1244, the Marinid Sultanate overthrew the Almohad Caliphate
> 	- Fez (Morocco) massacre of 1276
> 	- 1465 Moroccan revolution in Fez
> 		- Again, massacre of Moroccan Jews
> 		- End of Marinid Dynasty, and establishment of Wattasid Dynasty

> - More notes about pogroms on Jews by Berber Muslims: https://www.quora.com/Why-did-so-many-Muslims-commit-pogroms-on-Jews-throughout-history/answer/Oleg-Zachary-Kis
> 	- Virtually all of the pogroms and massacres that took place prior to the early 1900s when the Zionist agenda became activated were done in the context of Muslim vs. Muslim and Muslim vs. French colonialist conflicts in which the Jews, rightly or wrongly, were perceived as having chosen to favor the wrong side in those conflicts.
> 	- The sacks of Cordoba took place in the context of Berber vs. Umayyad conflict in which the Berbers massacred many non-Jews too.
> 		- The First Fitna happened starting during the third caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, where the caliph Uthman was accused of nepotism and killed by rebels. After him, Ali was elected as the caliph by the rebels.
> 		- Ali was non-violent, but since the rebels elected him, he was seen as an accomplice in the murder of Uthman by some. Ali also lost support when he arbitrated with Mu'awiya instead of defeating him, when he chose to plead in the name of Quran, which others said was a deceptive move. By Islam, the judgement had to be left to God, but Ali took matters into his own hands.
> 		- Ayisha (wife of Mohammed at 6), Talha and Zubayr revolted against Ali to depose him. In the Battle of Camel, they were defeated, and Ayisha was not killed, and pardoned, but blamed for the loss of life. She herself felt bad about it afterwards.
> 		- These rebels were Kharijites (the leavers, of caliph Ali), who later formed into a non-activist Ibadiyya. Sunnis believe the caliphs should be from Qurayshite descent, Shi'ias believe the Imams should be descendants of Ali, and Ibadis believe anyone can be a leader, and they need not rule the entire Islamic world.
> 		- Mu'awiya ibn Abu Sufiyan, the governor of Syria fought Ali. The first Kharijites were original supporters of Ali who rebelled against his acceptance of arbitration talks to settle the conflict with Mu'awiya at the Battle of Siffin. They asserted that "judgement belongs to God alone". They were defeated in the Battle of Nahrawan in 658. Ali was assassinated later in 661 by a Kharijite member.
> 		- The Ummayyad Caliphate was formed in 661 by Mu'awiya, and he kept the Kharijites in check. The Kharijite revolts continued into the the Abbasid period, but the militant groups were later eliminated, and were replaced by the non-activist Ibadiyya. Ibadis live in Oman and some parts of North Africa, and they condemn Kharijites as extremists.
> 		- Later, the Kharijite Revolt, or the Berber Revolt took place during the 10th Ummayad caliph.
> 		- The Berbers were taxed heavily by the Umayyad military caste, contrary to Islamic law. So many Berbers grew receptive to puritan Kharijite activists.

> Indians: 

> All Christian institutions in India are funded by the imperial British.
> Britain established Christian missionaries, schools and hospitals in India with better services.
> These private hospitals could've shared their profits to help bring up the standards of other government hospitals, but they chose not to.
> UK also funds India a lot as business investments.

> About Christians:
> My dad told me how he knew a Christian who would always go to the Church and confess his misdeeds every weekend. But after the confession, he would feel cleared of his sins, and he'd think to himself that now he's earned the right to sin again for the weekend. 
> 
> I used to think that Christians would only not refrain from sinning because they could always confess, but I never thought that they would sin routinely just because they just earned the right to sin. Again, this is a misuse of Christianity, because it is said that a true believer of Christ would at least feel the need to turn away from his sins. But you know, people can be mentally ill, such as having ADHD.
>
> I'm not sure if I'm missing some context here, such as if the sins are just human nature, as I'd say, about how religions are fundamentally restrictive of human nature, and in that sense, Christianity does help it in a slight sense. Because there is still the guilt of being a sinner for one's entire life.

	- Marx said that Jews are the embodiment of capitalism, which was correct, as that's how they had come to be under persecution. He however also questioned if they could be politically emancipated. His idea was that Judaism is so closely connected with capitalism, so without dropping that identity, society would never be free from capitalism.
> [!NOTE] From Wikipedia
> - > Karl Marx, 1843, On The Jewish Question, argued that Judaism is not only a religion, because it is an attitude of alienation from the world resulting from the ownership of money and private property, and this feeling of alienation is not exclusive to the Jews. Rather than forcibly converting Jews to Christianity, he proposed the implementation of a program of anti-Capitalism, in order to liberate the world from Judaism, thus defined. By framing his revolutionary economic and political project as the liberation of the world from Judaism, Marx expressed a "messianic desire" that was itself "quite Christian," according to David Nirenberg.
