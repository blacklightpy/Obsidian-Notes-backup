If we consider ray tracing, it would be wrong to assume that nature is performing a Monte Carlo approximation of random sample paths to get the light intensity at a point.

But doing infinitely many computations also seems unrealistic.

But force fields are like fluids, and fluid flow is more natural than mathematical..

So I could say that nature is simply acting like a fluid, but we humans try to use math to understand the deeper effects of matter, but we never get anywhere.
