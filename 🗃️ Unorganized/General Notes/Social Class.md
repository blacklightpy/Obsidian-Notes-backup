A social class or social stratum is a grouping of [[people]] into a set of hierarchical social categories.

The common classification has three divisions:
- [[Upper Class]] (wealthiest member of a class society, who wield the greatest political power)
	- It refers to someone who has wealth passed on by inheritance
- [[Middle Class]] (those who own small to medium sized businesses)
	- In the USA, this means those who have slightly higher income than the working class
- [[Working Class]] (those who work under wage-based contracts)
	- In the USA, this includes blue collar and pink collar jobs

Some people argue that due to [[social mobility]], class boundaries do not exist.
## Marx's Theory
[[Karl Marx]] defined class by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their relations of production).

According to him, in the modern capitalist society, the [[proletariat]] work, but do not own the means of production, and the [[bourgeoise]], those who invest and live off the surplus generated by the proletariat's operation of the means of production, do not work at all.
