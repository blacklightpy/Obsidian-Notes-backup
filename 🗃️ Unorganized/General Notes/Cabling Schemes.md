- Unbalanced Line
	- Pair of conductors to carry signals which have unequal impedances along their lengths and to ground and other circuits
	- Examples: Coaxial cable, Earth Return Telegraph 
- Balanced Line
	- Pair of conductors to carry signals which have equal impedances along their lengths and to ground and other circuits
	- It reduces common-mode noise and interference when fed to a differential device such as a transformer or differential amplifier
	- It eliminates common-mode noise because it has equal impedances, even if the [[signalling schemes|signalling scheme]] is single-ended
		- That is, just like differential signals, the voltage differential eliminates the common-mode noise, with the original signal retrieved.
		- However, the difference is that due to the polarity being the same, the retrieved signal will have a voltage which is the difference of the wires, while differential signals will have double the voltage due to opposing polarities.
	- Examples: Twin-lead cable, Twisted Pair cable (reduces EM interference from crosstalk too)

# Notes
- Twisted Pair cable may be shielded for additional noise immunity - Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) and Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) cables
	- Twisted Pair Cables are used to eliminate common mode noise in both differential signalling and in single ended signalling.
	- Different rates of twist are used for lines in the same cable to avoid crosstalk.
- Coaxial cables were described by the [[Telegrapher's equations]], used in [[Transatlantic submarine telecommunication cables]].
- Balanced lines are not to be confused with [[differential signalling]], which is a [[Signalling Schemes|signalling scheme]].
