## Revisions
They can be understood as three types.
- Erratum (Mistake)
- Corrigendum (Correction)
- Emendatio (Amendment)

IEEE Standards Association Standards Board Operation Manual, defines the differences between a corrigendum and amendment in Clause 1, 1.2. Though it's by the IEEE, it is applicable to all international standards. Basically, a corrigendum is:

> A document that only corrects editorial errors, technical errors, or ambiguities in an existing IEEE standard. A corrigendum does not introduce new material.
> 
> NOTE - A typical corrigendum may contain:
> - Corrections to equations, tables or figures, or their associated numbering or citations in the text
> - Corrections to technically incorrect sentences or paragraphs
