"We developed machines. The machines give us everything. We respect the machine, it gives us solace."

There are two types of machines we are referring to here. They are:
- The Machines of Automation
- The Social Machine

Similarly, God is what humans turn to when they cannot deal with the situation using logic alone.
But when humans become intelligent enough to automate life, they can rely more on the machines, and less on God.

The thing about following God is that, it is yet another social machine.
So the machine of following God is a machine that is different from other social machines.

The advantage of secular social machines is that it allows for multiple God backends.

An analogy:
