I refer to it as codification of experiences, from it's etymological root, "scire" that means "to know".

That is, rather than as a method to complete project of finding all the answers to human skepticism, I see it as a process of understanding what something is, what can be made with it, and how we can make something. That, and not about dealing with the philosophical "why".

So this idea of "science hasn't yet figured out" is not something that sits well with me. Science doesn't have to figure anything out for it to be of value. Science is just what we hold to be true.
