A belief is a subjective [[attitude]] that a [[proposition]] is [[truth|true]] or a state of affairs is true.

To believe something is to take it to be true. e.g. To believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition "snow is white".

However, holding a belief does not require active introspection. e.g. Few individuals carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. 

Moreover, beliefs need not be occurrent (e.g. a person actively thinking "snow is white"), but can instead be dispositional (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert "snow is white").
