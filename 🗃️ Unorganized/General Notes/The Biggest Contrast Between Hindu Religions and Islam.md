The biggest difference between Hindu Religions and Abrahamic Religions is that in Hindu religions, God judges a person according to their beliefs, and it rejects the idea that God will send forth human prophets to convey his message. It does say that God can take human incarnations on earth, however, he will only do so when it is necessary, and he will not leave a binding law.

In the Hindu religion, God would say that a bird is not to walk, and an animal is not to fly. But that does not mean that a bird shouldn't walk at all, because it will have to perch to eat food. But rather, a bird who tries to imitate animals may get caught by an animal. And if a human tries to jump off a cliff, he will die.

But in Abrahamic religions, if God says that a bird is not to walk, and it is found on the ground, it is to be punished for violating the law of God. Similarly, if a human is found breaking the law of God, they will have to be punished by humans for defying the law of God.

It is forbidden in Hindu religions to harm another person and say that it is done in the name of God.
