Capitalism is just Anarchism with structure.

In Anarchism, we know that people will kill each other.
So instead, we say - #todo (agree to live by common rules (do work to earn worth) - as long as you do that, you have living worth)

So, the society works on the principle of worth transaction.

Your childrens' worth is what you can give them.
"Son, your worth is what I can give you".
