You can only prove or disprove something under a set of axioms.

But religions create their own set of axioms, and we cannot prove or disprove them using it.

We cannot also create a set of axioms to validate religions, because religions reject those axioms as man-made.

So, religions are the epitome of lawlessness, rejecting all common senses and values.

But there is a way, because these religions are proselytized under languages.

So the words used in those languages carry meanings, and we can use them to create postulates.

So when the word is used by a religion, we can apply the postulates of the language to validate the religion.

This will not stop religions which create their own language, such as Arabic, but it will prevent the religion from spreading.
