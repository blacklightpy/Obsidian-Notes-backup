	- Enter Password
	- Enable wpa_supplicant service: `sudo ln -s /etc/sv/wpa_supplicant /var/service`
	- Restart DHCP Client Daemon: `sudo sv restart dhcpcd`
- Optional: Enable Audio Playback
	- System Update: `sudo xbps-install -Su`
	- Install ALSA: `sudo xbps-install alsa-utils` 
	- Add Pipewire and Pipewire-Pulse?
	- Add user to audio group: `sudo usermod -G audio <username>`

	- Install pipx: Forgot how
	- Install yewtube: `pipx install yewtube`
	- Install mpv as player: `sudo xbps-install mpv`
	- Start yewtube: `yt`
	- Set mpv as default player: `set player mpv`
	- Set DRM as video output: `set playerargs -vo drm`
	- Search for playlist: `userpl <username>`
	- Select Playlist by number
	- Play Songs by range (all or \* for all)

	- Regenerate initrd for kernel: 
- Setup the system by the installer
	- Set keymaps
	- Set Wi-Fi (the installer in an older ISO would only take SSID without spaces). Or can use wpa_supplicant manually in case this fails. 
	- Set hostname
	- Set source - local for ISO or network for latest image
	- Set locale (only for glibc version)
	- Set timezone
	- Set root password

	- Set bootloader partition
	- Set filesystems and mountpoints
	- Choose Install
	- Install grub bootloader with graphical mode enabled
	- After install, perform a system update
- Optional: Setup the system manually with BTRFS
	- NOTE: What I don't know (extras): Setting up LUKS (encryption), NVMe, SSD TRIM, 2FA
	- Set up BTRFS manually and setup subvolumes - root, home, snapshots and swap

			- `ln -s /usr/share/applications/pipewire-pulse.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/`
		-  For X11 based:
			- Add the following lines before starting the desktop environment
				- `exec pipewire&`
				- `exec pipewire-pulse&`
