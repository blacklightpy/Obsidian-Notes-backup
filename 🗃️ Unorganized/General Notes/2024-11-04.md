	- Encoding Ideas in the Mind (Personal)
	- Encoding Perceived Data (Metrics)

Encoded events form data, and meaningful data is information.

Science is information + a personal take.
The pillar of science is that the personal take should not conflict with meaningful data.

Also, the personal take should not conflict with the consensus when it comes to decisions.
Also, the personal take should not conflict with empathy when it comes to moral ethics.

	- "I found it there", "If you look back at the image I showed you before and the image two images before that one" - just give them labels!
