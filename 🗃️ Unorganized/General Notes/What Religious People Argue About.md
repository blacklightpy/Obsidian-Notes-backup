About Alcohol:
> A: Okay so the lotion I use doesn't make me high but it does relieve pain and itchy feeling. So that's halal right?
> 
> B: It’s fine if used in a cream form.  It’s medicine at that point and there’s no authentic Hadith I’ve ever seen that suggests alcohol itself is najis.  Even fruit has alcohol in it.  It’s drinking alcohol that is forbidden, and only then it’s alcoholic beverages that can get you drunk (and you don’t necessarily have to get drunk for it to be haram, if it intoxicates in large amounts then it’s haram even in small amounts).  There’s more alcohol in a glass of apple juice than a non-alcoholic beer for instance but your stomach would explode before you drank enough to feel the effects thus it wouldn’t be haram because it doesn’t intoxicate in large amounts.  This is the view I’ve seen most scholars take.

They think this a big concern - about the difference between prohibition of alcohol and other "feel good" things.
