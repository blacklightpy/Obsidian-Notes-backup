## In mathematics (geometry)
An intersection is a point, line or curve common to two or more objects.

The simplest case in [[Euclidean Geometry]] is the case of line-line intersection between two lines, in which there either is one point (or vertex) or there isn't one, in which case the lines are [[Parallelism|parallel]].

Types:
- Line-line intersection
- Line-plane intersection
- Line-sphere intersection
- Intersection of a polyhedron with a line
- Line segment intersection
- Intersection curve
