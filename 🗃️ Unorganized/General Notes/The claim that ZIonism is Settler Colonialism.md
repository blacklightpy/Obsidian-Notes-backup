Zionism is settler colonialism, but the thing is, not all forms of settler colonialism is bad.

When the Europeans settled in North America, they intended to purge the Native Americans and establish their colony.

But when the Zionists settled in, firstly they did not care about purging the Muhammadian population there, but only wanted to maintain control of the land. And secondly, this was only an opportunistic decision that came about after the World War I, when the Ottoman Empire Khilaafat collapsed and Britain decided to colonize the territory. If Britain did not, the Arabs would take it anyways, even though it was a Turkish empire.

Up until then, whenever Muhammadians ruled over Jews, they would collect a tax called Jizyah from them, as a form of humiliation to their superior religion, which was a fundamental element of Muhammadianity.

> In the Ottoman Empire the "jizya" was abolished in 1856. It was replaced with a new tax, which non-Muslims paid in lieu of military service. It was called "baddal-askari" (Arab. Military substitution), a tax exempting Jews and Christians from military service.

So while it would seem weird by Englightenment Age morals to go ahead and colonize another group of people, it should be noted that this is exactly what Muhammadians had been doing until the 20th century, and it was only during this timeframe that Zionism began.

Also, Zionism is not just relevant to 

I believe that Jews who reject the right of Jews to live in their original homeland
