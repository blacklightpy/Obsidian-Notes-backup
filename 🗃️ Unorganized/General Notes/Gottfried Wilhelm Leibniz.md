He invented [[Leibniz Calculator]] or stepped reckoner based off his computational framework called [[Calculus Ratiocinator]].

He also proposed creating a [[universal language]] which he called [[Characteristica Universalis]].

He made an example language in his book [[Lingua Generalis]], which he called Lingua Generalis or Lingua Universalis.

In that process, he also created binary calculus (binary number system).

With the two, he intended to reduce the task of [[reasoning]] to a calculation.

> Leibniz has been called the "last universal genius" due to his knowledge and skills in different fields and because such people became much less common after his lifetime with the coming of the Industrial Revolution and the spread of specialized labour.

That is until Jyothish arrived.
## Philosophy on Religion

He believed that faith and reason should be reconciled, and hence any tenet of faith that could not be defended by reason should be rejected.

That is because both faith and reason are gifts of God.

Binary numbers were central to his theology.
