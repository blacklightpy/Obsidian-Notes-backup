In [[genetics]], we distinguish between genotypes and phenotypes.

[[Genotype]] is an organism's full [[inheritance|hereditary]]

The terms [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]] are distinct for at least two reasons:
- To distinguish the source of an observer's knowledge
	- Because one can know about genotype by looking at the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]].
