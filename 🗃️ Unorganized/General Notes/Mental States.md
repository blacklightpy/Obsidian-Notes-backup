There is controversy concerning the exact definition of the term.

- According to [[Epistemology|epistemic]] approaches, the essential mark of mental states is that their subject has privileged epistemic access while others can only infer their existence from outward signs.
- [[Consciousness]]-based approaches hold that all mental states are either conscious themselves or stand in the right relation to conscious states.
- [[Intentionality]]-based approaches, on the other hand, see the power of minds to refer to objects and represent the world as the mark of the mental.
- According to functionalist approaches, mental states are defined in terms of their role in the causal network independent of their intrinsic properties.
