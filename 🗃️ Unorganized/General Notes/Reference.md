A reference is a relationship between [[Object|objects]] in which one object designates, or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The first object in this relation is said to refer to the second object. It is called a [[name]] for the second object. The next object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the [[referent]] of the first object.

A name is usually a phrase or expression, or some other symbolic representation. Its referent may be anything â€“ a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept.
