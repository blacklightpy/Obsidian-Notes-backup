Non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on [[axioms]] closely related to those that specify [[Euclidean Geometry]].

As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of [[metric geometry]] and [[affine geometry]], non-Euclidean geometry arises by either replacing the 5th postulate (parallel postulate) with an alternative, or by relaxing the metric requirement.

If the parallel postulate is replaced, we get [[hyperbolic geometry]] and [[elliptic geometry]], the traditional non-Euclidean geometries.

If the metric requirement is relaxed, then there are affine planes associated with the [[planar algebras]], which give rise to [[kinematic geometries]] which have also been called non-Euclidean geometries.
## Examples
- e.g. Lovecraftian worlds, for example, the city of R'lyeh in Cthulhu Mythos are non-Euclidean simply because they do not follow the laws of this universe, and not because he chose an alternate geometric model.
