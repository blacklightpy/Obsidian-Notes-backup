Rhetoric is the art of persuasion. It is one of the three ancient arts of discourse ([[trivium]]) along with [[grammar]] and [[logic]]/[[dialectic]].

As an academic discipline within the humanities, rhetoric aims to study the techniques that speakers or writers use to inform, persuade, and motivate their audiences.
