Geometry is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with the properties of space such as the distance, shape, size and relative position of figures.

Until 19th century, geometry was almost exclusively devoted to [[Euclidean Geometry]], which includes the notions of [[point]], [[line]], [[plane]], [[distance]], [[angle]], [[surface]] and [[curve]] as fundamental concepts.
