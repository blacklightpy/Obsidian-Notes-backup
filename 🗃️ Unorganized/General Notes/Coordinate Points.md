Coordinate Points are also called just coordinates.
## In the Cartesian Coordinate System
The prototypical example of a coordinate system is the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

In the [[plane]], two [[perpendicularity|perpendicular]] lines are chosen and the coordinates of a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines.

In three dimensions, three mutually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] planes are chosen and the three coordinates of a point are the signed distances to each of the planes. This can be generalized to create n coordinates for any point in n-dimensional Euclidean space.
