In [[geometry]], two [[geometric objects]] are perpendicular if their intersection forms right [[angle|angles]] (angles that are 90 degrees or $\frac{π}{2}$ radians wide) at the point of intersection called a foot.

The condition of perpendicularity may be represented graphically using the perpendicular symbol, ⟂.
