- The Parable of Analogy
	- If you stick with one model, a set of rules can break it
	- If you change the analogy, you have to change the whole set of rules that apply to it
	- For example:
		- If one claims that word of god exists, I can bring the finite letters argument
		- But if they then bring the analogy of a CPU, then the hardware-software argument applies
	- Simpler example

- Dictionary Attack
	- Do not call captive women slaves, or yourselves slave owners
	- But instead, call them "my girl"
	- But also, know that you have rights over them, and they are not equal to free people
	- Essentially this is slavery, but it denies any claims that this was slavery
	- Because this is not uncontrolled slavery, but controlled slavery

- Parable of Deceit #rough
	- People tend to believe wrong things until they hit a hard disagreement
	- This is because they were given religion at a young age, and with that, they forget that they had a natural inclination to do good things. 
	- This is because truths are not completely known in reality
	- And some things are not even in the space of dichotomies
	- And when the brain accepts many things from a set of concepts as true and neutral, it is likely to gloss over the fact that some of these concepts are false or evil
	- Example 1:
		- Reading the Bible (Personal Experience)

- Parable of Utopia
	- Shari'ah is a way of peace
	- It's just that it's a way of imbalance
	- If a child would spend its entire life in its home, and only eat from the garden, it would be peaceful
	- But it's just that, that's not what a child is designed to do
	- Fitrah (Natural Disposition) as outlined in the Shari'ah is not my natural disposition at least
	- They say that "whoever Allah leads astray, no one can guide him"
	- But in reality, that's what every self-centered person says when others don't behave in the way he expects them to
	- "One day you will realize and be humbled" is the most subjective argument that doesn't mean anything
	- Such an argument has value when someone is way off some empirical truth one has experience with
	- But you it has no value when you are just spouting your idea of what is the right

**My Philosophy** #rough #post
My philosophy is founded on two basic principles, that is:
1. Punishment is not a deterrent for crime
2. We are only guided by our desires

I'd have preferred to quote the AURORA lyric "We're guided by the lust".
However, "lust" commonly refers specifically to sexual desires.
What I meant was that all actions are taken based on monetary benefit.
Even selfless actions are taken on a monetary benefit, with the wealth being the welfare of others.

Firstly, I don't even give too much connection between the words sexual and desire.
I understand it in terms of sensual desires.

A sexual relationship is defined as a relationship in which one has sex.
However, I do not see why the action of sex defines the relationship more than intimacy.
To me, sex is simply one of the ways in which intimacy can be achieved.

The main reason is religion, however, I do not recognize the societal models of religions as valid.

Those who deny these two basic truths will lose, in the most miserable manner.
Miserable, because people deny these truths to claim the moral high ground, despite feeling the same way themselves.
They deceive people who lack self discipline and struggle to control their feelings by telling them easy to believe lies.
In doing so to achieve personal satisfaction, they perpetuate a culture where people of their own kin are harmed.

And the real evil that exists as lust is "achieving personal satisfaction at the expense of others."
Who is guilty of this? People who have consensual intimate relationships, or people who kill such people, acting as
