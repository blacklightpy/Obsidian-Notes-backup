I often have this problem where I start writing about something, and then.. all of a sudden, I get two perspectives on it at the same time. (I hope I won't get it now - I just did, however, that's the less problematic version of it). Now you would say that I could represent one thought in detail first, then the other. But there's a problem. Here we go:

## Example 1

Context: I get two ideas that I could expand on. Flow 1 and 2.
### Text

Flow 1 (placeholder)

Flow 2 (placeholder)

This doesn't seem problematic right away, you could finish one point and move on to the next.
## Example 2

Context: I expanded the flows given in

See the problem here?

To properly arrange the ideas collected in this order to make a proper piece of writing is a bit difficult. Especially when this keeps happening over and over.

A solution is, as described in the original post [[Fixing LLMs to turn them into AI]], which I will quote here for preservation (in case I modify that file later; now skip ahead to the next section):

I'll organize them according to the **"broad divisions of thought"**, and **"the order in which I placed them"**, and according to **"the order in which I wrote the lines"**. I don't really remember the order in which I thought the lines XD; I'll also study this condition in [[Difficulties of Writing 1 - Representing the Diverse Flow of Thought]])

to practice writing with pen on paper.
