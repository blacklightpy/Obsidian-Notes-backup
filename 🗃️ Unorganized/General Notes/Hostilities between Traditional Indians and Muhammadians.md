In 1946, Jizya was collected from Traditional Indians during the Noakhali genocide.

The Noakhali genocide took place in Bengal, now part of Bangladesh, an incident where Traditional Indians were raped and forcibly converted to Muhammadianity, and were forced to pay Jizya to the All India Muslim League.

The All India Muslim League was disbanded later, but the Indian Union Muslim League operates in Kerala as an Islamist party.
