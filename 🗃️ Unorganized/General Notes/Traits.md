### Phenotypic Traits
A phenotypic trait, or just trait, or character state is a distinct variant of a phenotypic characteristic of an organism. It may be either [[inheritance|inherited]] or determined environmentally. But typically occurs as a combination of the two.

e.g. Eye colour is a character of an organism, but the specific colour of the eye (blue, brown, hazel, etc.) are traits.
