A lattice is an abstract structure studied in the mathematical subdisciplines of order theory and abstract algebra.

It consists of a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has a unique supremum (also called a least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (also called a greatest lower bound or meet).
