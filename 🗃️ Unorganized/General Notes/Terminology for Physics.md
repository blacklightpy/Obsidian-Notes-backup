# About Motion
## Terminology
Mechanics originates from Machine.
Machine comes from the word `*megh-` (`*megh` means "to be able").

Metre originates from Metron.
Metron comes from the word `*meh_1` + tron (from `*trom`) (`*meh_1` means "to measure").

Motion originates from Motio.
Motio comes from the word `*mowetjō`, which is similar to moveo + teo .
Moveo comes from the word `*moweō`, which comes from `*m(y)ewh_1` (`*m(y)ewh_1` means "to move").

So "motion" comes from "move", "metre" comes from "to measure" and "mechanics" comes from "ability".
## Result
- Laws of Motion can be understood as "Laws of Moving Bodies"
- Mechanics can be understood as "Abilities of Bodies"
- Physics can be understood as the "Study of Things"
- Quantum Physics can be understood as "Study of Particles"
- Quantum Mechanics can be understood as "Abilities of Particles"
