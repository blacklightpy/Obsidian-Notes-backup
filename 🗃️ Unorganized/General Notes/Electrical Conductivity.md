Electrical conductivity or specific [[electrical conductance]] is the reciprocal of [[electrical resistivity]]. It is a [[specific property]] that represents the ability of a material to conduct electric current.
## Notation
It is commonly denoted by $\sigma$, $\kappa$ (in electrical engineering) and $\gamma$.
## Formula
$\sigma = \frac{1}{\rho}$,

where $\rho$ is the electrical resistivity.
## SI Unit
Siemens per metre (S/m)
## Dimension
$\text{M} ^ \text{-1} \text L ^ \text {-3} \text T ^ \text 3 \text I ^ \text 2$
