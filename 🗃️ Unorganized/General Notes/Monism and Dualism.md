A doubt arose for me about the differences between dualism and monism, in that in one sense, people can be said to have separate minds and bodies, or united minds and bodies. At the same time, the simulation theory states that the mind is the only reality and the physical world is only an illusion. This is another form of duality, which isn't full monism. And also, mind-body monism is different from universal monism too, with consideration of ontological distance between people.

Depending on perspectives, I guess all some of the senses can co-exist.

- Duality of Mind and Body in a Single Person (Material and Abstract Dualism)
	- e.g. Rene Descartesâ€™ Dualist philosophy
- Duality of the Universal Observer and Physical World (Material Monism and Abstract Dualism)
	- e.g. Sankhya Darshana of Vedic Hinduism
- Monism of Mind and Body in a Single Person (Material Dualism and Abstract Monism)
	- e.g. Yoga Darshana of Vedic Hinduism
- Monism of All Things (Material and Abstract Monism)
	- e.g. Advaita Vedanta Darshana of Vedic Hinduism
