They are intervals smaller than a semitone.

In Indian music theory, they are called [[shruti]] (not to be confused with the Vedic shruti).

Shruti is the interval or step, while Swara is the specific note or pitch.
Some say shruti is the octave. Generally, I think it means the key.
Svara also refers to the solfege of the Carnatic music system.

There are 22 shrutis in Hindustani music, but 12 are more prominently used and are called musical notes.
The Carnatic (Karnataka) music system has 24, with influence from Arabic music.
