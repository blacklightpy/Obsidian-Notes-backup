It is a type of connector in which a sharpened blade in the connector is forced through the insulation, bypassing the need for stripping.

When done properly, this makes the connector blade form a [[Cold Welding|cold weld]] with the cable, theoretically creating a gas-tight connection.
# Use
They were originally only used in extra-low voltage applications, such as telecommunications, networking and computer components.

Later, they were also used for low voltage domestic and industrial applications, due to the faster installation.
