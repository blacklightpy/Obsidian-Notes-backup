Metonymy is a [[figures of speech|figure of speech]] in which a concept is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing or concept. 

[[Polysemy]], the capacity for a word or phrase to have multiple meanings, sometimes results from relations of metonymy. e.g. for example, "chicken" means the meat as well as the bird, and "crown" means the object, as well as the institution
# Types
[[Synecdoche]] and metalepsis are considered specific types of metonymy.

- Synecdoche uses a part to refer to the whole, or the whole to refer to the part.
- Metalepsis uses a familiar word or a phrase in a new context.
	- For example, "lead foot" may describe a fast driver; lead is proverbially heavy, and a foot exerting more pressure on the accelerator causes a vehicle to go faster (in this context unduly so). The figure of speech is a "metonymy of a metonymy".
