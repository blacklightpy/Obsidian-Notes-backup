In analytic philosophy, philosophy of language investigates the nature of language and the relations between language, language users, and the world.

Investigations may include inquiry into the nature of [[meaning]], [[intentionality]], [[reference]], the constitution of sentences, concepts, [[learning]], and [[thought]].
