Codec is a portmanteau of coder and decoder. This is analogous to endec in electronic systems which is a portmanteau of encoder and decoder.

Codecs are used to encode audio and video files into standard formats or to decode them for playback or conversion. A multimedia codec library is used to support various different media formats.

## Codec Packs
- K-Lite Mega Codec Pack (We mainly need the LAV Filters from it)
- Combined Community Codec Pack (CCCP)
- libavcodec from FFmpeg
- XviD
- DivX (Proprietary)

## Projects
- FFmpeg - A multimedia toolbox (includes several codecs including CCTV and arcane codecs)
- Libav (merged with FFmpeg)
- GStreamer - It's a multimedia framework larger than FFmpeg, used for complex pipelines
	- It internally uses libavcodec from its "gst-libav" (name changed during the libav fork)
- AviSynth - It is a filter based tool for transferring video frames from one application to another without using temporary files, also known as a frameserver. It is used in video post-production workflows for [[Non-Linear Editing]] of videos.
- Apple Quicktime (Proprietary)
### DirectShow Filters
Both below are basically 3rd party DirectShow [[filters]] based on FFmpeg

- ffdshow, a codec library based on FFmpeg providing DirectShow filters and Video For Windows codecs
	- Discontinued in favour of LAV Filters
- LAV Filters (formerly LAVFSplitter; based on libavcodec and libavformat of FFmpeg)
	- Contains Splitters and Decoders
	- Splitters
		- LAVFSplitter
		- Haali Media Splitter
