Phenetics, or Taximetrics or Numerical [[Taxonomy]] is an attempt to classify organisms based on overall similarity, usually with respect to their [[morphology]] or other observable traits, regardless of their [[phylogeny]] or evolutionary relation.

It is closely related to [[numerical taxonomy]] which is concerned with the use of numerical methods for [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] calculation.
