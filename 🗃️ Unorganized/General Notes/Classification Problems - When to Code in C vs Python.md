This is related to the classification and clustering problems of sticking to the ==UNIX philosophy,== in terms of atomic units, which also sticking to the simple implementations.

In order to give an answer to this, we must have a proper understanding of the underlying implementations to decide when the Python implementation is not too far off in performance compared to the C implementation.

RELATED: See my other idea in Zettel Notes about how the ==core parts of the program should be made faster==, but the less important parts will not improve the overall speed even if it is made to be faster.

Also relevant is the analogy between ==cohesion and coupling==.

The topic that will define this problem is ==clustering and classification==.
