It is the fun science experiment where a table floats when connected by strings.

The 2D version needs 3 strings to stay in place. The 3D version needs 4 strings to stay in place.

> Tensegrity, tensional integrity or floating compression is a structural principle based on a system of isolated components under compression inside a network of continuous tension, and arranged in such a way that the compressed members (usually bars or struts) do not touch each other while the prestressed tensioned members (usually cables or tendons) delineate the system spatially.
