- Both humans are animals are sentient and feel pain, so what's the difference?

- When a human is harmed, it starts agonizing because it has dreams to live for
- But an animal, i.e. food animal doesn't perceive the world like humans do, and lives routinely

So it is less sentient in that manner compared to, say, dogs and dolphins.
