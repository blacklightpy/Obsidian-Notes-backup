They can be used for arithmetic, or they can be used as static identifiers.

As IDs, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. all have the same value. Only the time of addition differs, that is, if the numbers were assigned sequentially.

For example, the 117 Billion people who've lived in earth can be uniquely identified by a sequence of 12 10 decimal digits, as 117000000000, or using just 37 bits (4.625 bytes).
