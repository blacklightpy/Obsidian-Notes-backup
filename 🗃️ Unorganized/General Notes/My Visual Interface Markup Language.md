I'd prefer for menus to be custom modified, but with the option to inherit some defaults. This will make it easy for people to create apps, but also let them customize it to their imagination as well.
# More Aspects
- Add Text

Is displaying all about canvas and compositing? No, because it also includes behaviour and interactions. So we need to learn:
- Types of compositions (learn from PicsArt)
- Types of behaviours (learn from animations and graphics)
- Types of interactions (learn from UX metrics and philosophy)
