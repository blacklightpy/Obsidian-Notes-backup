Phonology is a branch of [[linguistics]], which is a layer above [[phonetics]], which deals with what the units of speech are.

A segment is a basic unit of sounds. For example:
- Phonemes are segments of a word
- A words is a segment of a statement or a poetic line
- A line is a segment in a stanza
- A sentence is a segment in a paragraph

Suprasegmentals involve the parts of speech that are related to the combination of segments.

For example:
- Spaces
- Stress
- Pitch
- Timing
- Rhythm
- Prosody
