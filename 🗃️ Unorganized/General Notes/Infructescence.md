Infructescence (fruiting head) is defined as the ensemble of [[fruits]] derived from the [[ovaries]] of an [[inflorescence]]. It usually retains the size and structure of the inflorescence.

In some cases, the infructescences are similar in appearance to simple fruits. These are called [[multiple fruits]].
