This is my new neutral term for the creed of Muhammad.

Islaam is a vague word like say Kaaraaite Jews. Islaam means "submission", and Kaaraa means "to read" in Hebrew, and "to recite" in Arabic.

It is submission to what, that makes all the difference. And Kaaraa is word that means different things when used by Jews and by Muhammadians.

So, the right label for any group of people should be what defines them, unless it's using a proper noun as their label. Islaam is not a proper noun, neither is Christian. But Christ is a proper noun, and it's meaning is clear, and so is the meaning of the word Christian.
