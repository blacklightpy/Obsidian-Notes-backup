Parallelism is a property of [[affine geometry|affine geometries]] and [[Euclidean geometry]] is a special instance of such a geometry.

The simplest case that defines parallelism is that of [[parallel lines]], which is the subject of study of Euclid's 5th postulate (parallel postulate).

Parallel lines are coplanar infinite straight [[line|lines]] that do not [[Intersection|intersect]] at any point. If two lines are non-coplanar, then they are [[skew lines]].

[[Parallel curves]] are identical [[curve|curves]] that curves that do not intersect or touch each other tangentially and keep a fixed minimum distance.
