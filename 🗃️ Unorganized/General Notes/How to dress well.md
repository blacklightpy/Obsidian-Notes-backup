My personal idea is to imagine what I want to look like, getting them tailored well, and if I'm not feeling like detailing it yet, I can just select readymade fashion. In either case, I plan my budget on a spreadsheet.

Now let's take a look at The Style Theorists' video: ["How to Dress Rich"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnLTR-9HCBs).
# Key points
- The rich don't wear flashy outfits to stand out
- Pop stars like Cardi B or Billie Eilish tend to buy flashy Guccis
- The history of fashion in new money (or [[new rich]]) and [[old money]]
	- There's old money and new money
	- Old money is generational wealth
	- New money is about people who just hustled their way to the top
	- In the 1700s-1800s, the rich used more fabric and expensive dies
	- As the 1900s neared, the poor got wealthier and it was getting hard to distinguish who were the old rich
	- The war started and broke the economy
	- That's when quiet luxury started
	- The old rich learned not to stand out too much, but instead just blend in
	- Flaunting their wealth would get them ostracized for it by media (#EatTheRich)
- Quiet Luxury
	- It was also known as Stealth Wealth
	- It's all about being subtle
	- Quiet luxury is about minimalism and having a custom tailor fit
	- Minimalism includes clean lines, simple silhouette and neutral or natural colours (black, white, beige)
	- They may also add in small simple pieces of accessories, as opposed to big flashy jewellery
	- They choose brands that are not well known, but the people who know do know them
	- They do not care about standing out
- New Rich
	- They tend to wear flashy items, with the biggest highlight being that the brand name is known
	- The brand name is a status symbol
	- So in addition to drawing attention to themselves, they want to draw attention to their wallet
	- They keep following trends as they change
