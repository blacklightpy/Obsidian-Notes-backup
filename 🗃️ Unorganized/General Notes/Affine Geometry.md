Affine geometry is what remains of [[Euclidean geometry]] when ignoring the [[metric]] notions such as [[distance]] and [[angle]].

Since [[parallel lines]] are one of the main properties of geometry that is independent of any metric, it is often considered the study of parallel lines or [[parallelism]].
