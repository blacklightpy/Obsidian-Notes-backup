Things that can destroy [[Agile]]

* Dont get caught up in functional silos (boxes)
   eg: Marketing, Engieering, Quality, Manufacturing divisions

- Functions > Requirements
* Leader should optimize the transition to Agile
* Change is difficult: Crawl > Walk > Run
* First define previous work culture, then define what it needs to be

How to track transition
* Agile works with user stories replacing the marketing requirements document
* Observe the number of user stories added - this is a good metric

Agile with a small "a" (agile):
-   Sprints
-   A mechanism to track progress so that it is visible and transparent
-   Indication of accomplishment
