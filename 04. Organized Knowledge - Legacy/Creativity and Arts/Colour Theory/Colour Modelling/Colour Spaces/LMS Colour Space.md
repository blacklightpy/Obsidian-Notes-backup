L, M and S are the types of cone cells in the human eye.
The [[Spectral Sensitivity]] of each cell is mapped to this color space.

It is mostly used is [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] research.

It also makes it easy to model some of the per-cone gain adjustments that happen in the retina. The retina adjusts the sensitivity of different cones when trying to white balance a scene and some digital imaging white balancing algorithms mimic these operations in LMS space. This method is called the [[von Kries transform]].
