Unique colours or hues were first described by Ewald Hering in his theory of [[Opponent Processes]].

He defined the unique hues as red, green, yellow and blue, and based them on the concept that these colours could not be simultaneously percieved.

For example, a colour cannot be both red and green, because they would cancel out to yellow.

There is a great deal of variability when defining unique hues experimentally, but a single observer can set their experience of a unique hue extremely consistently, and to within a few nanometers.
