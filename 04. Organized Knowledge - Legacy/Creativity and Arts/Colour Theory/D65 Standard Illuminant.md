The D65 is a [[Spectral Power Distribution|spectal power distribution (SPD)]] in increments of 5nm from 300nm to 830nm, using [[linear interpolation]] on the original data binned at 10nm.

It is intended to represent the average mid-day light in Western Europe, comprising of both sunlight and light diffused by a clear sky. Hence, it is also called the daylight illuminant. It has a [[Correlated Colour Temperature]] of about 6500K.
