It is an experience in the universe.

We may think we only have one life, but we've lived many different lives through movies and stories.

To experience life in coexistence, we have to consider the physical existence of every object, including our bodies. Our bodies provide us with all the facilities required to experience life in the physical world. So we must take care of our bodies by keeping good habits. Without a functioning body, we will not be able to percieve the world, and that condition is known as death.

A good explanation was given by Erwin Schrodinger:
"Living things avoid decay from disorder and equilibrium."
