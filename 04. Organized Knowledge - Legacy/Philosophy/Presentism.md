The philosophy that only the present moment exists. This is in contrast to the ideas of possiblism (past and present exist) and eternalism (past, present and the future exist).

In presentism, the past did exist, but does not exist. So there are facts from the past that are in the present, but not so for the future, because it does not exist. Any statements made about the future are "predictions" about a possible world.

There is no concept of time in presentism, and the flow of time is how the mind percieves the present.
