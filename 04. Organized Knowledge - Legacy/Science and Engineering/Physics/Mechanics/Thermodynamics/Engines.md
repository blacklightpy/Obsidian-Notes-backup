				- Radial (Cylinders Radiate Outward)
		- Rotary Engine / Wankel Engine
	- Air Breathing / Continuous Compression
		- Gas Turbine Engine
			- **Types**
				- Turbo Prop (Turbine Engine that drives a Propeller)
					- Efficient at low speeds and altitudes, best for regional airliners and cargo planes
					- Typically operate at below Mach 0.6
				- Turbo Shaft
				- Prop Fan
- Electric Motors
## Reaction Engines
- Jet Engines
	- Air Breathing / Continuous Combustion
		- Gas Turbine Engine

					- Typically operate at above Mach 0.8
				- Turbofan / Fan Jet
		- Advanced Technology Engine
		- Ram Compression
			- **Types**
				- Ram Jet
					- Most efficient at speeds above Mach 2
					- **Types**
						- Air Turbo Ram Jet (Combines Turbojet and Ramjet)
						- Dual-Mode Ram Jet
				- Scram Jet / Supersonic Compression Ram Jets
					- They operate in the hypersonic range, above Mach 5
				- Shcram Jet / Shock Compression Ram Jets
		- Non-Continuous Compression
			- **Types**
				- Motor Jet
				- Pulse Jet
					- **Types**
