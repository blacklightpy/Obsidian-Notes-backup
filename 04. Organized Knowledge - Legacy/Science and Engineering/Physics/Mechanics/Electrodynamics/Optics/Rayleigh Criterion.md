Rayleigh criterion states that the maximum resolving power of a lens is limited by diffraction to the ratio of the wavelength of the waves to the diameter of the lens' aperture.

$\theta \approx 1.22\lambda/D$  (considering that $sin(\theta) \approx \theta$ )

D is the diameter in metres.

The factor 1.22 is derived from a calculation of the postion of the first dark circular ring surrounding the central [[Airy disc]] of the diffraction pattern. This number is more precisely 1.32966989.., the first zero of the order-one Bessel function of the first kind $J_1(x)$ divided by $\pi$.
