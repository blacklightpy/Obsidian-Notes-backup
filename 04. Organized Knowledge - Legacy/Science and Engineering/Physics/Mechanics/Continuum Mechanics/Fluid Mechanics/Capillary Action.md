It is due to the forces of [[Adhesive Force|adhesion]] and [[Cohesive Force|cohesion]] ([[Surface Tension]]).

What about the role of atmospheric pressure and gravity?

# How it works
- The liquid has cohesive forces in the form of surface tension.
- The adhesive forces on the capillary tube attract water molecules near the walls of the tube upwards.
- The water molecules attract other water molecules upwards due to surface tension.
- The adhesive forces attract more water molecules upwards
- This can go on until the weight of the water column elevated matches the forces of adhesion and cohesion.
