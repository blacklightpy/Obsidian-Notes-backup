Fundamental particles or elementary particles are subatomic particles which cannot be further divided. 

The standard model has 17 distinct fundamental particles - 12 fermions and 5 bosons.
As a result of flavour and colour charges and anti-particles, fermions and bosons are known to have 48 and 13 variations respectively, constituting 61 fundamental particles.
### [[Fermions]]
They are subatomics particles with fractional spin quantum numbers. They obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. They are: 
- [[Quarks]] and Antiquarks
- [[Leptons]] and Antileptons
### [[Bosons]]
They are subatomics particles with integer spin quantum numbers. They obey Bose-Einstein statistics. They are:
- [[Gauge Bosons]]: [[Photons]], [[W and Z Bosons]], Eight types of [[Gluons]], [[Gravitons]] (hypothetical)
- [[Scalar Bosons]]: [[Higgs Boson]]
### [[Hadrons]]
They are [[Composite Particles]] made by two or more quarks held together by [[Strong Interactions]]. Each hadron must fall under the category of either a boson or a fermion. They are of two types:
- [[Baryons]]
- [[Mesons]]
### Quasiparticles
#### Fermion-like
- Three degrees of freedom of an electron within a molecule (charge, spin, orbital) can be seperated by the wavefunction into three particles: Holon, Spinon, Orbiton
- An electron that doesn't revolve around a nucleus lacks an orbital and hence is unsplittable, and is regarded as an elementary particle.
#### Boson-like
- Cooper pairs, plasmons and phonons are observed to behave as bosons.
