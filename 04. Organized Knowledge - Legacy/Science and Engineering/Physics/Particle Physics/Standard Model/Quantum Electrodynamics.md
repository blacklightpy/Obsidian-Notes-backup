Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) explains interactions of electric charges using virtual photons and the electromagnetic field. It is the relativistic quantum field theory of electrodynamics.

It was the first theory which achieved full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity.

QED served as the model and template for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such example is [[Quantum Chromodynamics]].
