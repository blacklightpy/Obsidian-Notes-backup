It is described by [[Quantum Flavordynamics]], and now more accurately by [[Electroweak Theory]].
# Doubts
- Both electrically charged and neutral particles can interact with weak interactions
- Weak interaction is the only interaction that can change the flavor of a quark or lepton
- Weak interaction breaks both P (parity symmetry) and CP (charge-parity symmetry), and is the only one that does them.
