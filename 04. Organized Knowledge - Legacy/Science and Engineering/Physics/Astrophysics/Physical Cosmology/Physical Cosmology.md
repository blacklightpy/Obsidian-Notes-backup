It is the branch of cosmology which deals with understanding the origins and the timeline of the universe based on the understanding of physical laws.

Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang Theory]], which tries to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics. More precisely, a standard parameterization of the Big Bang Theory with dark matter and dark energy, known as the Lambda-CDM model.

The [[Î›CDM Model]] is described as the standard model of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that aligns with the observations.
