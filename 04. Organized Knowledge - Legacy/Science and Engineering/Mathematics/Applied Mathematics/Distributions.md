Distributions, also known as Schwartz Distributions are 

- The product of a distribution by a smooth function cannot be extended to an associative product on the space of distributions.
  
	Example: 
	If $p.v.\frac{1}{x}$ is the distribution obtained by the [[Cauchy Principal Value]],
	
	$(p.v.\frac{1}{x}(\phi)=\lim_{\epsilon\to0^+}\int_{|x|\geq3}{\frac{\phi(x)}{x}dx}$ for all $\phi \in S(R)$  
	
	If $\delta$ is the [[Dirac Delta Function|Dirac delta distribution]], then
	$(\delta\times x)\times p.v.\frac{1}{x}=0$ 
	but,
	$\delta\times (x\times p.v.\frac{1}{x})=\delta$
