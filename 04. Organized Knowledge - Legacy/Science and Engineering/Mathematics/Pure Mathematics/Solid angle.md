- Used to measure FOV
- Unit: steridians

$\Omega = \frac{A}{r^2}$ 

- Solid angle from a person's view to the moon is about the same as that of the sun, which is evident during a solar eclipse
- Solid angle of a sphere measured from any point in its interior is $4\pi$ steridians.
- Solid angle subtended by a face of a cube to its centre is 1/6th of that, or $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ steridians.
- Solid angle can also be measured in square degrees

1 sr = $(\frac{180}{\pi})^2$ square degrees
- It can also be measured in square minutes, square seconds or fractions of sphere ($\frac{1}{4\pi}$) sr, also known as spat

1 sp = $4\pi$ sr
- In spherical coordinates,
$d\Omega = sin(\theta)d\theta d\phi$, where
$\theta$ is the colatitude (angle from the North Pole) and
$\phi$ is the longitude
