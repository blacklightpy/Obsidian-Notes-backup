This was a question asked to me by Kalra

- Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)

For extracting key points and descriptors:
- Principal Component Analysis based Scale Invariant Feature Transform (PCA-SIFT)
- Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF)

For Indexing and matching:
- Locally-sensitive Hashing (LSH)

# Note
In Computer Vision, SIFT is a feature descriptor
**Other feature descriptors:**
- GIFT
- HOG ^ffb7e9
- SURF
- GLOH
- LBP
- VLAD
