A Quantum TM or Universal Quantum Computer is an abstract machine used to model the effects of a quantum computer.

In essence, the internal states of a classical TM are replaced by pure or mixed states in a Hilbert space. The transition function is replaced by a collection of unitary matrices that map the Hilbert space to itself.
