It is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating or alternating current (AC) signal, usually a sine wave, a square wave, or a triangle wave, powered by a DC source.
# Classification
## By the frequency of their signal
- Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO): Produces frequencies below 20 Hz
	- This term is used in the field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from audio frequency oscillators
- Audio Oscillator: Produces frequencies between 20 Hz to 20 kHz
- RF Oscillator

## By behaviour
- Linear / Harmonic Oscillator (makes sinusoidal waves)
- Nonlinear / Relaxation Oscillator (makes square / triangular waves)
# Examples
The most common linear oscillator is a crystal oscillator, in which the output frequency is controlled by a piezo-electric [[Resonator]] consisting of a vibrating [[Quartz|quartz crystal]].

In common language, resonators refer to low budget, or ceramic oscillators, while oscillators refer to [[Crystal Oscillator|crystal oscillators]].
