It is a rotary electrical switch, which reverses the direction of current periodically.
It is used in DC machines to have current flowing in the same direction.

With wider availability of AC, we started using [[Alternator|Alternators]] and AC synchronous or induction motors instead.
Also, with cheaper semiconductor technology, Brushless DC motors are also being used.
