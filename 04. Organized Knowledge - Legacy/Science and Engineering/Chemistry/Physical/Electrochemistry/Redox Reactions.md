Oxidation refers to the loss of electrons.

An oxidation is always accompanied by a reduction. Hence they are called Redox reactions.

Oxidation was initially used to refer to the formation of Metal Oxides, but the pattern of the reactions found a larger scope later.

The reducing agent or reductant is an electron donor. It oxidizes itself, reducing something else.
The oxidizing agent or oxidant is an electron absorber. It reduces itself, oxidizing something else.

==So basically, the oxidizing agents get reduced and reducing agents get oxidized.==
