The Nobel Prize for 2023 was for generating attosecond interval photon pulses. This opened up the branch of chemistry called attosecond chemistry.

This could help out map the trajectories of electrons as they move significantly at attosecond speeds. (1000 times smaller than a femtosecond).

There are as many attoseconds in a second as there have been seconds since the estimated age of the universe.
