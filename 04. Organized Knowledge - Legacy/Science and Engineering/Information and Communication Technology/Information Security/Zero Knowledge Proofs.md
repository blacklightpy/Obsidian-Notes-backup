Proving something is true without showing any information.
Concept first mentioned in a 1985 paper.
Can prove it to a very high probability, but cannot give air-tight proofs.
Used in Nuclear weapons policy decisions.
# Types
- Interactive
	- Proof has to be performed at each request seperately
- Non Interactive
	- Can be computationally intensive
	- Zcash is working on a lighter algorithm
# Definition
A formal definition of zero-knowledge has to use some computational model, the most common being that of a Turing machine.
