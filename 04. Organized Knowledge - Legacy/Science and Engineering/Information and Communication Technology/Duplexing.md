A duplexing communication system can be either half-duplex or full duplex.
## Half Duplex
In a half-duplex system, communication only works in one direction at a time.

A walkie-talkie is an example of a half-duplex system because both users can communicate with one another, but not at the same time, someone has to finish transmitting before the next person can begin.
## Full Duplex
In a full-duplex system, both users can communicate at the same time.

A telephone is the most common example of a full-duplex system because both users can speak and be heard at the same time on each end.
