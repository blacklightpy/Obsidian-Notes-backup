# How to use
1. Be clear about what CI/CD does
	1. CI runs when changes are made and checks that it works with the rest of the code. It builds, runs tests and checks for any errors.
	2. CD deploys the built code into production.
2. GitHub Actions have a "choose your adventure" style of configuration.
3. GitHub Marketplace has a lot of actions and tests for you to pick from too.
