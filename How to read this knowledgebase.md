There's a saying that good design should be one that does not require a manual.

However, this vault is a highly detailed repository of knowledge, and without a manual and a proper organizational structure, one will not be able to find the information they are looking for.

It is definitely possible to browse this vault without a manual, however, it is always good to have a guide, so that you can understand the specific convention of organization used here which includes tags and hierarchy, and the rationale behind it.
