### In Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition
A feature is any piece of information that is relevant for solving the computational task related to a certain application.

### In Computer Vision and Image Processing
A feature is a piece of information about the content of an image. Simply put, it is the interesting part in an image depending on the task at hand.

Image Processing tends to have a very sophisticated collection of features compared to the general definition used in pattern recognition. In Computer Vision, it tends to be dependent on the specific task.
