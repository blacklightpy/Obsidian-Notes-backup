Welcome!

This is a public site where I take notes on things that I'm studying about. You can call this a knowledge-base or to use the modern terminology, a second brain or digital garden.
## How to explore

You have **Directory Tree** on the left, and the **Table of Contents** on the right.

You can explore the notes using the search functionality or from the table of contents sidebar. A quick overview on the main categories:

- **01. Personal:** Where I keep notes on some stuff I'm personally interested in, because I'm lazy to keep them more private (although not much sensitive information will be there)
- **02. To Share**: Stuff I tend to share with others for fun.
- **03. Culture:** Notes pertaining to culture and general life.
- **04. Organized Knowledge - Old Format:** My old classification of knowledge  
- **05. Organized Knowledge - New Format:** My new classification of knowledge  
- **06. Collected Knowledge:** 
- **07. Miscellaneous:** Unorganized, but not really the same as "knowledge"
## Other Notes

This site additionally features a **2D graph view** for all the notes, and also as a separate global view. While this may not be very useful, it can help to see the ways in which some groups of tightly related topics connect to a very different set of topics.
