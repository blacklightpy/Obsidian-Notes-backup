Welcome!

This is a public site where I take notes on things that I'm studying about. You can call this a knowledge-base or to use the modern terminology, a second brain or digital garden.
## How to explore

You have **Directory Tree** on the left, and the **Table of Contents** on the right. (They may not both show up in mobile devices due to their small viewport).

You can explore the notes using the search functionality or from the table of contents sidebar. A quick overview on the main categories:

- **ü§† Personal:** Where I keep notes on some stuff I'm personally interested in, because I'm lazy to keep them more private (although not much sensitive information will be there)
- **üåé Public**: Notes on something that is cool for arbitrary reasons, but doesn't belong in any knowledge-base categories..
- **üîÆ World Building:** Notes on Science, Engineering, Philosophy, etc. which can be used to make the world a better place.
	- Note that you may not see a conventional ordering of categories here. For example, I consider "computer science" to be a subcategory of "mathematics", "optics" to be under "electrodynamics" and "fluid mechanics" under "continuum mechanics".
- **üó∫Ô∏è World Exploration:** Not to improve the world per se, but just exploring the world around us for the sake of it.
- **üóÉÔ∏è Unorganized:** Most notes I take are under the "General Notes" section here, because I can be too lazy to organize them.
## Other Notes

This site additionally features a **2D graph view** for all the notes, and also as a separate global view. While this may not be very useful, it can help to see the ways in which some groups of tightly related topics connect to a very different set of topics.
