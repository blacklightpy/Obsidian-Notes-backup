Welcome!

This is the Vault of Knowledge, a public place where I take notes on things that I'm studying about. You can call this a knowledge-base or to use the modern terminology, a second brain or digital garden.

The name for the website was inspired by a place of the same name in the game [Sky](https://www.thatskygame.com/).
## How to explore

You have **Directory Tree** on the *left*, and the **Table of Contents** on the *right*.

You can explore the notes using the search functionality or from the table of contents sidebar. A quick overview on the main categories:

- **ü§† Personal:** Where I keep notes on some stuff I'm personally interested in, because I'm lazy to keep them more private (although not much sensitive information will be there)
- **üåé Public**: Notes on something that is cool for arbitrary reasons, but doesn't belong in any knowledge-base categories..
- **üîÆ World Building:** Notes on Science, Engineering, Philosophy, etc. which can be used to make the world a better place.
	- Note that you may not see a conventional ordering of categories here. For example, I consider "computer science" to be a subcategory of "mathematics", "optics" to be under "electrodynamics" and "fluid mechanics" under "continuum mechanics".
- **üó∫Ô∏è World Exploration:** Not to improve the world per se, but just exploring the world around us for the sake of it.
- **üóÉÔ∏è Unorganized:** Most notes I take are under the "General Notes" section here, because I can be too lazy to organize them.
## Other Notes

This site additionaly features a **graph view** for all the notes in both 3D and 2D, under each page, and also as a separate global view. While this may not be very useful, it can help to see the ways in which some groups of tightly related topics connect to a very different set of topics.

I haven't taken the time to style out the website, but this is it for now. I went with that it is better to make something than avoid doing anything at all while waiting for perfection.
