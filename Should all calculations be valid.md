I was thinking about telling my friend that a game requires 10 billion bytes!! (i.e. 10 GB, and "giga" is the unit prefix denoting a factor of a billion). Just for a dramatic effect. Then I thought, I'll find the number of binary digits, and tell him that the game requires 80 billion binary digits!! All stored without mistakes on your computer!!. Then I thought, I'd just tell him that the game requires so and so number of decimal digits, and with $\log2^\text{80 billion}$, that would have around 24 billion digits.

Then, I wanted to explain that in words, and after a bit of thinking, I figured out that the number is $10^{2.4*10^{10}}$, which is a simple form of writing $10^\text{2 billion}$, and you know it lies between $10^{{10}^{10}}$ and $10^{{10}^{11}}$ for me to look it up on the googology wiki.

And $10 \uparrow \uparrow 11$ is a "Googolthrong".

Now $10^10^9$ is a "Maximusbillion", or a "Billionplex", or a "Billiplexion" (the name "Billiplexion" seems to be preferred, and "Maximusbillion" is not preferred. And $10^{3*10^9}$ is a "Disekatommyrillion" or "Trlastillion".

But then I wondered, $k^{ab}$ = $(k^a)^b$  = $(k^b)^a$ = $k^{ba}$.

So $10^{2.4*10^{10}}$ can be $(10^{2.4})^{10^{10}}$ or $(10^{10^{10}})^{2.4}$.

Now we know that the result is 1 followed by 24 billion 0s. However, it becomes difficult to believe that $10^{2.4}$, an irrational number (251.19), when raised to a billion times will form a perfect number like 1 followed by 24 billion 0s.

A simpler version would be $10^{24}$, which would be $(10^{2.4})^{10}$ or $(10^{10})^{2.4}$. It's hard to imagine that when 251.19 when multiplied by itself 10 times would lead to 1 followed by 24 zeroes. Now I didn't perform this manually, and used an automatic reasoning model to $1.00005*10^{24}$, which is very close to the actual number!

**Another example:**
So I wanted to try this out with a simpler number to see the steps myself (although I could've maybe used Python to see a long form calculation). In my naivety, thinking that since $100$ is twice the power of $10$, I thought that $10^{24}$ would be $100^{2.4}$ (i.e. thinking $10^{2.4*10}$ = $100^{2.4}$, because it is $(10^{10})^{2.4}$) and decided to compute it. But that came out to be $10^{4.8}$, because unlike my wrong assumption, $100^{2.4}$ was $(10^2)^{2.4}$, not $(10^{10})^{2.4}$. The result was thus $10^4 * 10^{0.8}$, which was $10000 * 6.30957 \approx 63095.7$. So this only happens for numbers at the scale of ten billion and above, since that's when you get $10^{10}$.

Now the math works, but with a loss of precision. This made me wonder, should these kinds of calculations even be valid? [This is in relation to my studies about making mathematics purely discrete, like 1) how I wrote on my local notes about how circles do not exist, and hence neither does pi, and 1.1.) the appearance of a circle only occurs to us because we are not zooming in enough to render the minor lines at the surface of what looks like a circle, all of which should have discrete lengths, and therefore the best approximations of circles, even in the ideal sense are uniform polygons of a high enough and finite number of sides, and 1.2) therefore there is no meaningful relation between the line joining the center of the polygon and a side or corner, and the perimeter of the polygon, except that 1.3) when the number of sides increases, this ratio tends to converge on a certain value, which we call pi, and also 2) how I tried to come up with a number system that removes 0 from the number system, effectively not seeing it as a number, and hence solves the paradox of division by 0, since such a division won't be logical - but that turned out to have already been a thing called the bijective base-10 number system, and had been the number system used in Japan and Korea.] For example, $10^{2.4}$ is $10^{12/5}$. The $10^{12}$ part is easy, but $10^{1/5}$ is $\sqrt[5]{10}$. That made me wonder how roots work. That is, if there could ever be an n-th root of 10 far down the line, where we would get a rational number. Because the entire idea of computing $10^\text{24 billion}$ as $(10^{2.4})^\text{10 billion}$ involves taking an irrational number like $\sqrt[5]{10}$, and then raising the result first to 12, and then the result of that to "10 billion", that is, effectively raising it to "120 billion". Or for the simpler case, computing $10^{24}$ when written as $(10^{2.4})^{10}$ involves taking $\sqrt[5]{10}$, raising it to 12 and then by 10, that is, effectively by "120".

So, you find that if when you multiply this irrational number by itself 120 times, you get a simple number like $10^{24}$, which is a "100 billion billion billion billion billion billion". However, thinking about it, multiplying $\sqrt[5]{10}$ by itself 120 ti 

It's like going into meaningless territory to make a leap of faith and get to the result safely. But then, we only get the perfect results because we stick to the realm of abstractions, and never expand the numbers really.
