# Overview
### Church Denominational Structures
- Congregationalist Structure (independent and self-governing / Baptist, Pentecostal, Evangelical)
- Episcopal Structure (hierarchical, with bishops governing dioceses / Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox)
- Presbyterian Structure (governed by elders (presbyters) in a representative system / Reformed, Presbyterian)
- Synodal Structure (governed by councils or synods, often shared between clergy and laity / Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestant)
### Church Organizational Structures
- Local and Congregational
	- Church (building and community)
	- Parish (smallest ecclesiastical division, often a single congregation / led by a parish priest or pastor)
	- Mission (a church or community in a region that's expanding in Christianity / often associated with evangelization)
- Regional and Jurisdictional Levels
	- Diocese (geographical district with multiple parishes / governed by a bishop in Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox Traditions)
		- Metropolitan See (the primary diocese within an ecclesiastical province / governed by a metropolitan archbishop)
	- Eparchy (same as diocese / governed by an eparch in Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches)
	- Deanery (subdivision within a diocese or eparchy, with a group of parishes / led by a dean)
	- Vicariate (a district within a diocese or mission territory / often under the care of a vicar or missionary bishop)
	- Province / Ecclesiastical Province (a cluster of dioceses or eparchies grouped together / led by an archbishop or metropolitan, who oversees the primary diocese (archdiocese))
	- Patriarchate (a jurisdiction of major significance / often led by a patriarch in Eastern Orthodoxy, Eastern Catholicism and Oriental Orthodoxy)
	- Exarchate (a jurisdiction for missionary regions not yet organized into dioceses / East)
- Global and Supra-Regional Levels
	- Autocephalous Church (self-governing church / in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy)
	- Holy See (jurisdiction of the Pope in the Catholic Church, in the Vatican City)
	- Synod (a council or assembly of bishops or church leaders governing a particular church or denomination)
### Special Church Buildings and Titles
- Basilica (special designation given to certain churches by the Pope in the Catholic Church / can display the papal insignia)
	- Major Basilicas (Four basilicas in Rome)
	- Minor Basilicas (Everywhere else)
- Cathedral (principal church of a diocese, where the bishop's official chair (cathedra) is located)
- Chapel (smaller place of worship, associated with a school or hospital / not the center of a parish or diocese)
- Shrine (churches or sacred spaces with special significance, often linked to a saint, relic or miracle)
- Abbey (part of a monastery or convent / governed by an abbot or abbess)


- Exarchate:
    
    - A jurisdiction for missionary regions or communities not yet organized into dioceses.
    - Common in Eastern Catholic and Orthodox traditions.
- Prelature:
    
    - A church jurisdiction under the oversight of a prelate (bishop or archbishop), not necessarily tied to a geographic area.
    - Example: Personal Prelature of Opus Dei.
- Ordinariate:
    
    - A structure created to serve specific groups of faithful within a broader church, often with unique liturgical or cultural needs.
    - Example: Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans within the Catholic Church.
- Titular See:
    
    - A diocese that no longer has a resident bishop due to historical reasons but is retained as an honorary title for bishops.
    - Common in Catholicism.

#### **Special Church Buildings and Titles (Expanded)**

- **Oratory**:
    
    - A small place of prayer, often private or semi-private, but with the ability to hold public worship services.
- **Pro-Cathedral**:
    
    - A temporary cathedral used until a permanent one is built.
- **Minster**:
    
    - A church historically associated with monastic communities or missionary work in certain regions, particularly in England.
- **Collegiate Church**:
    
    - A church endowed with a college of canons or priests but not designated as a cathedral.
    - Example: St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.

### **Additional Notes on Terminology**

#### **Distinctions Between Terms**

1. **Basilica vs. Cathedral**:
    
    - A basilica is designated based on historical, architectural, or spiritual significance, while a cathedral is defined by its function as the seat of a bishop.
    - A church can be both a basilica and a cathedral (e.g., St. Peterâ€™s Basilica).
2. **Church vs. Chapel**:
    
    - A church generally serves a parish or larger community, while a chapel is often smaller and tied to an institution (e.g., schools, hospitals).

#### **Overlapping Jurisdictions**

- Some structures, like **military ordinariates** or **personal prelatures**, serve people based on circumstances rather than geography, adding a layer of complexity to church governance.

### **Historical Context**

- **Historical Evolution of Church Structures**:
    
    - The **Apostolic Age** focused on house churches and informal gatherings.
    - By the **Post-Constantinian Era**, dioceses and provinces were formalized to reflect the structure of the Roman Empire.
- **Impact of Reformation**:
    
    - The **Protestant Reformation** led to the simplification of church structures in many denominations (e.g., congregational and presbyterian systems).
