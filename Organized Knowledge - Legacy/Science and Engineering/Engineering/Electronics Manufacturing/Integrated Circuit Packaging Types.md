- Land Grid Array (LGA)
	- Opposite of a PGA i.e. Pins protrude from the motherboard, and the IC has pin holes
	- **Pros**
		- Not prone to damage
- Pin Grid Array (PGA)
	- Use pins to make connections
	- **Types**
		- Ceramic PGA (CPGA)
		- Plastic PGA (PPGA)
		- Staggered PGA (SPGA)
		- Flip-Chip PGA (FCPGA)
- Ball Grid Array (BGA)
	- Use solder balls to make connections
	- **Pros**
		- Can be reballed
		- Easy to desolder
	- **Cons**
		- Hard to repair, because solder joints can only be checked by X-Rays
		- Only usable in multi-layer PCBs
- Ceramic Column Grid Arrays (CCGA)
	- Used in military and space applications due to extreme reliability
	- Not used in consumer applications due to restrictions by RoHS in the EU

- System-in-Package (SiP) / 3D IC (stacked)
- Package-on-Package (PoP)
- Multi Chip Module (MCM)
- Network on a Chip
