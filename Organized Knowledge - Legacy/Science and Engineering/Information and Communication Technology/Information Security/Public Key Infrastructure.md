Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system that encapsulates centralized encryption systems like CAs to provide an interface for secure communications. This system has a centralized trust model.

**Pros**
Users don't have to worry about choosing between multiple trust models since there is only one model, and it works as strong as we trust the certificate issuer's security rather than the algorithm
**Cons**
Users have to follow the trust endorsment of the CA signed certificates
