Public Key Cryptography is a system of cryptography using two sets of keys: private and public.
It can be used in the following ways:
**For Secure Communications**
- The reciever's public key can be used to encrypt a message
- The message can only be decrypted using the reciever's private key
**For Digital Signatures**
- The private key can be used to sign a message
- The public key can be used to verify that the message was actually signed using the private key

## Types of authentication protocols
- GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) Keys
- SSH (Secure SHell) Keys
- X.509 Certificates issued by CA for S/MIME Authentication

## Digital signature algorithms
- DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
