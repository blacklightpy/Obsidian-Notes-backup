Quality Assurance (QA) Engineering in DevOps involves designing [[Tests]] to ensure the quality of production code.

The term QA Engineer itself could be too broad and can refer to software development or industries.

QA Engineers can refer to testers who write manual tests. They are also referred to as QA Testers. They can get trapped in the testing ecosystem with not all companies realizing the importance of testing. 

Those who write [[Automated Tests]] for DevOps are more referred to as QA Engineers, and are paid on the level of software developers. 

Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) is another designation, where a person has both software development skills as well as testing skills.
