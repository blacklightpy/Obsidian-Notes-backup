# Open Systems Interconnection Model
- Developed by ISO to form a standard model for computer networks

## Layers of OSI Model
It has 7 layers, which are as follows from top to bottom:
### Application Layer
- End User Layer, where applications access the network services
- e.g: HTTP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS
### Presentation Layer
- Where the data format specification and encryption are performed
- e.g: SSL, SSH, IMAP, FTP, MPEG, JPEG
### Session Layer
- Maintains connections and controls ports
- e.g: APIs, Sockets, WinSock
### Transport Layer
- E2E data transmission
- e.g: TCP, UDP
### Network Layer
- Physical path of data
- e.g: IP, ICMP, IPSec, IGMP
### Data Link Layer
- Defines format of data in the network
- e.g: Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge
### Physical Layer
- Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium
- e.g: Coax, Fiber, Wireless, Hubs, Repeaters
