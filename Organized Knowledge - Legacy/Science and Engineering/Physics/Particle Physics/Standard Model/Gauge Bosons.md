They are the particles responsible for forces between other particles. The known force carrier bosons all have spin = 1 and are therefore known as vector bosons.

The hypothetical [[Gravitons]] have spin = 2 and is a tensor boson. But it is not known whether it is a gauge boson as well.

There are four types of gauge bosons:
- [[Photons]] (they are the EM )
- [[W and Z Bosons|W Bosons]]
- [[W and Z Bosons|Z Bosons]]
- [[Gluons]]
