It studies the interactions between quarks and the strong nuclear force.

- Mesons and Baryons are made up of quarks
- Quarks have fractional charges and half spins
- More than two quarks with equal spin in the same region would violate Pauli's exclusion principle
- So a new parameter named colour charge was established for quarks
- The colour charges were red, green and blue, analogous to the primary colours in human colour perception
- Only combinations of colour charges that result in a neutral charge would be valid
- In other words, colour must be conserved, with the net colour charge being zero
- This would also explain particles with only two quarks by using anti-quarks which have anti-colours
- Quarks are bound together by a binding force, mediated by [[Bosons]] called [[Gluons]]
- When attempting to remove a quark

Chiral Symmetry breaking - quark confinement - Forming pions - Served as a prototype and an ingredient for the Higgs Mechanism
