- They have the spin quantum number of 1/2
- They don't have [[Color Charge]]
- They have integer electric charges
- They participate in weak interactions
### Three generations (+1 and 0 electric charges respectively)
1. Electron and Electron Neutrino
2. Muon and Muon Neutrino
3. Tau and Tau Neutrino

and their respective anti-particles. Anti-leptons have the same mass, mean lifetime and spin, but opposite electric charges.

- An antielectron is also called a positron.

There are 6 distinct types of leptons, and together with their anti-particle variants, there are 12 types of leptons.
