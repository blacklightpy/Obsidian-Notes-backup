Firstly, I'll start off by saying that I don't know anything about this theory. I do know that it states that mass curves spacetime, and acceleration is due to the apparent motion of particles along that line.

# Einstein Field Equations

$G_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = \kappa T_{\mu \nu}$

I will have to question:
- What is the abstract of this theory?
- What is $G$?
- What is $\mu$?
- What is $\nu$?
- What is $\Lambda$?
- What is $g$?
- What is $\kappa$?
- What is $T$?

# Answers
- $G_{\mu \nu}$ is the Einstein tensor
- $g_{\mu \nu}$ is the metric tensor
- $T_{\mu \nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor
- $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant
- $\kappa$ is the Einstein gravitational constant

Now I have to ask:
- What is a tensor? A: A tensor is a multidimensional array of numbers, in the order o
- What is the Einstein tensor?
- What is the metric tensor?
- What is the stress-energy tensor?
- What is the cosmological constant?
- What is the Einstein gravitational constant?

# Answers
- The Einstein tensor is a tensor defined as $G_{\mu \nu}=R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R$
  - It is also known as the trace-reversed Ricci tensor (or Ricci curvature tensor)
  - It is used to express the curvature of a pseudo-Reimannian manifold

Now I have to ask
  - $R_{\mu \nu}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor
  - $R$ is the scalar curvature
