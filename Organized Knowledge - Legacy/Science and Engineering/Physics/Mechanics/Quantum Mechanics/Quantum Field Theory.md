It explains the apparent dual nature of microparticles in a unified theory.
It combines quantum mechanics with special relativity.
# List of quantum field theories
- [[Quantum Electrodynamics]] (QED) - Deals with electromagnetism and [[Photons]]
- [[Quantum Chromodynamics]] (QCD) - Deals with strong nuclear forces between [[Quarks]] mediated by [[Gluons]]
- [[Quantum Flavordynamics]] (QFD) - Deals with [[Weak Interactions]] and [[W and Z Bosons]]
- [[Quantum Hadrodynamics]] - An effective field theory that explains [[Hadrons|hadron]]-hadron interactions
- [[Quantum Hydrodynamics]] - Deals with hydrodynamic-like systems which exhibit quantum mechanical behaviour
- [[Electroweak Theory]] (EWT) - Unifies QED and QFD at the high energies observed in the [[Electroweak Epoch]] of the universe according to the [[Î›CDM Model]] of [[Physical Cosmology]]
