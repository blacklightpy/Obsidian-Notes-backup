They are values generated by Grassman function.
Their property is that they are anticommutative. That is:

If $\theta_a$ and $\theta_b$ are two Grassman numbers,
then $\theta_A$ $\theta_B$ = -$\theta_B$ $\theta_A$

Also, $\theta^2=0$   

This property is used to describe the field values of [[Fermions]] and that can be used to explain the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
They are used to complete the missing elementary particles of the standard model in the theory of [[Supersymmetry]]
