# Jerk

A jerk or jolt is the rate of change of acceleration over time

Jerk = da/dt

# Yank

A yank is the rate of change of Force over time, i.e. jerk multiplied by mass

Yank = dF/dt

If mass is not constant
F = dp/dt = ma + v dm/dt (Remember the rocket calculation in school?)
Y = dF/dt = mj + 2a dm/dt + v d^2m/dt^2

# Other higher derivatives of force (or position)

Snap/Jounce = d^4x/dt^4
Crackle = d^5F/dt^5
Pop = d^6F/dt^6

# Use cases

- Human behaviour modelling (balancing a cup)
- [[cam synthesis]]
