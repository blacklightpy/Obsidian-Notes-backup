Quantum Efficiency (QE) is the ratio of electrons generated per photon for a given wavelength.

QE is dimensionless as a ratio, but is closely related to [[Spectral Responsivity]], which is measured in Amps/Watt.

- QE for photographic films is around 10%
- QE for [[Charge-Coupled Devices|CCD]] is around 90%
