Every photometric value has a corresponding radiometric value due to their simple relation. A few examples are given here:

| Photometry         | Radiometry                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Luminous Energy    | Radiant Energy            |
| Luminous flux      | Radiant flux              |
| Luminous intensity | Radiant intensity         |
| Luminous Exitance  | Radiant exitance          |
| Illuminance        | Irradiance / Flux Density |
| Luminance          | Radiance                  |
