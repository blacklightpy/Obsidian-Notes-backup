Newton described the Laws of Motion as follows:
- First law / Law of Inertia: All objects continue to be in a state of rest or uniform motion unless and until an external force is applied
- Second law: The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the force applied to it
- Third law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction
