# Types of Analog Filters
### Based on Components Used
- RC Filters

## Based on band filtered
- Low pass
- High pass
- Band pass
- Band reject
- All pass

### Based on active components
If an active component lke op-amp or transistor is used in RC filter, it is called:
- Active filter

# Uses of Analog Filters
- Avoid aliasing by ADCs or DACs
	- In ADCs, antialiasing AF ensures i/p signal does not contain any component above the Nyquist frequency.
	- In DACs, the reconstruction analog filter ensures that no dangerous or unwanted frequency components are created by the limited resolution and sampling rate of the DAC.
- Analog signal modulation for re-transmission
- Prevention of Signal-to-Noise ratio problems in multiple stage amplification
- Power Quality Modulation

- It's an analog world
