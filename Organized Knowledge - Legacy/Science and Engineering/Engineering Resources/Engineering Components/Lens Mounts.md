## Types
### Embedded
Metric thread mounts exist for CCTV and Machine Vision applications. e.g. M4, M12, etc. (Ref: ISO Metric Screw Thread)

- S or M12: No flange, BFD <1mm - 12 mm. f\1.6 or slower
	- Mechanical design for this mount type is not standardized. Each M12 is different.
- CS: FFD 12.526 mm. f\1.0 range

### DSLR Cameras
- Lecia M
- Fujjfilm X
- Nikon Z
- C Mount: FFD 17.526 mm
- Micro Four Thirds: FFD 19.25 mm

- Flange Focal Distance (FFD): distance from the mount point to the film/sensor. a.k.a Back Focal Distance (BFD), Flange-to-Film distance, Flange Focal Depth, Flange Back Distance (FBD), Flange Focal Length (FFL) or register
- There are lens mount adapters to convert between mounts, but additional lenses should be added to compensate for the flange distance. Normally C mount lenses can be used with CS mount, but not vice-versa due to
