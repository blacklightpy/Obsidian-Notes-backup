In [[Video]], luma represents the brightness in an image. Luma is typically paired with [[Chrominance]]. Luma represents the black and white image, while chroma represents the colour image. 

Converting images to luma and chroma allows for [[Chroma Subsampling]], because human vision has finer spatial sensitivity to luminance differences than chromatic differences.
