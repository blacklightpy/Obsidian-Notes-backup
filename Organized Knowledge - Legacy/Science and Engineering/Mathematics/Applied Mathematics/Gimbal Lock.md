It refers to the situation when an axis of rotation is lost when two of the three axes of rotation aligns together. This happens when rotations are represented by Euler angles.

## Solutions

- Using a motorized 4th axis which maintains a large angle between the yaw and roll axes
- Shifting one of the locked axes to an arbitrary angle to reset the lock
- Avoiding the use of gymbal and using systems based on [[Quaternions]]
