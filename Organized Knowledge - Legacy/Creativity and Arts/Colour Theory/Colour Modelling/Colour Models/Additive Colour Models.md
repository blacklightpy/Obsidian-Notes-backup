They are colour models that represent represent the additive mixing property of light, where a colour can be predicted by summing up the numerical representations of component colours.

The properties of additive mixing are given by Grassman's laws, which is not valid under all conditions.

They are applied in the design of digital displays like CRT, LCD, etc. which represent colours using [[Phosphor|phosphors]] that emit a limited set of [[Primary Colours]].

Examples are:
