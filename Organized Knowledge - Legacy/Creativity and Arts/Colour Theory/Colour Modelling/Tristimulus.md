Tristimulus is the term given to the perception of colour from three different sensors.

Tristimulus values are the resultant excitation of each sensor for a light of any given wavelength in relation to the other sensors.

Tristimulus value for each sensor is calculated as the sum of the product of [[Spectral Power Distribution]] (SPD) of the colour with the colour matching functions or [[Spectral Sensitivity]] of the sensor for each wavelength. 

That is, **for example:**
Assuming an RGB system, if $S(\lambda)$ is the SPD function of a light source and $\bar{r}(\lambda)$ is the spectral sensitivity of the red sensor, the tristimulus value R of the sensor would be:

$R=\int_{\lambda}S(\lambda)\bar{r}(\lambda)d\lambda$, where normally $\lambda\in [380, 780]$

Generally the radiometric value used in the SPD is [[Radiometry|spectral radiance]] for emitting sources, but for reflected light it can be SPD of [[Reflectance]] or (transmittance) multiplied by the SPD of the illuminant factor.
