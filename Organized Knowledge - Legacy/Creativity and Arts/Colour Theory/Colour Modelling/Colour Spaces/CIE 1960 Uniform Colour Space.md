CIE 1960 Uniform Colour Spaces has been superceded by the [[CIE 1976 Uniform Colour Spaces|CIE 1976 UCS]].

It does not define a luminance or [[Lightness]] component, but the Y [[Tristimulus]] value of the XYZ [[Colour Space]] or a lightness index similar to W* of the 1964 UCS ([[CIEUVW]]) are sometimes used.

Today, the CIE 1960 UCS is mostly used to calculate [[Correlated Colour Temperature]], where the isothermal lines are perpendicular to the [[Planckian Locus]].

# Motivation
- Judd determined that a more uniform colour space could be found by a simple projective transformation of the [[CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space|CIEXYZ]] tristimulus values.
