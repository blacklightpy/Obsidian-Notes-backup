It is another colour space that is referred to as Lab, like [[CIELAB]] ($L^*a^*b^*$).
It was also derived from [[CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space]].

L is a correlate of lightness and is computed from the Y [[Tristimulus]] value using Priest's approximation to [[Munsell Colour System|Munsell]] value:
$L=100\sqrt{\frac{Y}{Y_n}}$, $Y_n$ is the Y tristimulus value of a specified white object.
a and b are termed [[Opponent Processes|opponent colour]] axes.

[[CIELAB]] has almost entirely replaced Hunter Lab.
