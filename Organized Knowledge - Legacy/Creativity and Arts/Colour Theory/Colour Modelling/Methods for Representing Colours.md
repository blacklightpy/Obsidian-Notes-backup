- [[Colour Models]] define ways to represent colours as a combination of paramters.
- [[Colour Space|Colour Spaces]] are representation of colours as a combination of parameters. Colour Models are mapped to colour spaces to form a system that is easy to use.
- [[Colour Appearance Models]] (CAM) are advanced models that try to model the perceptual aspects of colour mapping.
- [[Image Colour Appearance Models]] (iCAM) are CAMs that also account for [[Optical Illusions]] that are dependent on the images in context.
