Relative luminance ($Y$) follows the [[Photometry|photometric]] defintion of [[Luminance]] $L$ including spectral weighting for human vision, but while luminance $L$ is a measure of light in units such as $cd/m^2$, relative luminance $Y$ values are normalized as 0.0 to 1.0 (or 1 to 100, with 1.0 being a theoretical perfect reflector of 100% [[White Point|reference white]].

The use of relative values is useful in [[Colour Appearance Models]] that describe perception relative to the eye's adaptiation state and a reference white.

For CIE [[Colour Space|colour spaces]] [[CIE 1931 XYZ Colour Space|XYZ]] and [[CIE xyY Colour Space|xyY]], the letter $Y$ refers to relative luminance.
