Agile is a project management methodology involving a number of tools like [[Kanban]], [[Scrum]], [[Extreme Programming]], etc.

Agile originated from modern development practices such as [[Lean]]. It involves fast feedback loops and iterative development in contrast to the [[Waterfall]] method, where everything follows a pre-defined path from start to finish. 

Modern day software development is highly centered on agile methodologies. To implement a proper agile environment, it is necessary to understand the philosophy behind agile in addition to the systems.
# Philosophy
The [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) describes 12 principles which form the philosophy of agile.

Some of them are:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan
