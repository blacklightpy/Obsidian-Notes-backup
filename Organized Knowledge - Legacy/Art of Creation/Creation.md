- Everything is made of energy.
- Creation begins with objects.
- The universe is comprised of objects and spaces around them.
- Objects can be further divided into smaller objects.
- These smaller objects are called [[Particles]] of the larger object.
- All objects are created by assembling particles of some form.
- All objects have common properties as everything is made of the same particles at some level. This process is called inheritance.
- As objects get more complex, we use previously created objects in their modelling to reduce complexity. This is called modularity.
	- Modularity increases the energy required for building an object in some instances, because it is only an approximation of the required model, and not perfect. 
	- However, in the long run, it is better to use a modular design to save time in creation.
	- Perfect also doesn't always exist, because at a basic level, there are multiple ways of doing something, all with different advantages and disadvantages you can't choose from.
	- In that case, decisions have to be made using a choice.
- Properties of objects are called physics.
- Properties of interactions between particles is called alchemy or chemistry.
- Creation comes from imagination and the representation of a dream is called art.
- The creation of an object from an idea is called craft.
- Objects have a definition and colour.
- Definition is the hard boundary of an object and colour is the essence of an object.
- Definitions of an object are described using mathematics.
- The colour of objects are described using design.
- Objects undergo decay over time due to interactions with other particles.
- Systems that are taken care of timely avoid decay.
- Any system that protects itself from decay is termed as living, and the property of protecting itself from decay is known as life.
- The process of creation and destruction of particles is called nature.
