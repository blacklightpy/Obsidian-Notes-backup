In the flow of nature, things have a tendency to deviate from a state of order into disorder, or equilibrium.

So in order to keep things intact, we must do work to reorder the state of things. Naturally, the more components there are in a system, the more the chances of things deviating from order.

Knowledge is an organized collection of information and data, so knowing more things come at the cost of increased state of disorder in the mind, and that requires the body to do more work to keep knowledge intact.

Also more importantly, having knowledge about a thing can cause you to not be able to see aspects of that thing that might be visible to someone who does not know much about that thing. This happens due to the mind observing the thing with focus on the aspects of it that you already know about.

So it is important to sometimes look at objects without assigning names and attributes to them based on your knowledge.
