Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was a field marshall, revolutionary statesman, author and the founder of the Republic of Turkey. He was a religious skeptic and a freethinker.

Following the fall of the Ottoman Empire, he established the Republic of Turkey as a secular state. According to Ataturk, the Turkish people do not know what Islam really is and do not read the Quran. People are influenced by Arabic sentences that they do not understand, and they go to mosques following their customs. When Turks read the Quran and think about it, they will leave Islam.

He gave a prayer as an example, which translates into praying for destruction for Abu Lahab and his wife, who were Quraysh members who opposed Mohammed.
