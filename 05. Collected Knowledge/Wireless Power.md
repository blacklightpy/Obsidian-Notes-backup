We have NFC, RFID Scanning, Wireless Charging, etc.

But omni-directional radiators waste a lot of power, according to the area of the sphere, which spreads out with the area increasing by $r^2$.

Directional wireless power transmitters could be used to conserve power perhaps. However, it still drops by $1/r^2$, only the gain is increased as a constant.

e.g. I found form Reddit (didn't read): https://spectrum.ieee.org/air-power (40% efficient 60W transfer over 2m)
