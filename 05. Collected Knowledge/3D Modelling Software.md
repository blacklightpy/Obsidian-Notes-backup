Blender and other 3D Modelling software offer interactive ways to generate 3D objects in computers.

The objects are fundamentally made of vertices which are connected by edges and the faces are filled with colours.

Just like any other software, the models generated in a 3D Modelling Software can be exported in a standard format that allows using the model in other software such as game engines.
