# Foreword
I wrote this in a reply to someone who was pissed of at how the media put up the graduation poster of a black person who was mauled to death by two Pitbulls while trying to break in to a white guy's house.

I had started it with "To play the devil's advocate, I think ".

The left wing position is that Black people do wrong things, but they believe that:

1. They are that way due to historic oppression, just as third-world countries show how poor people turn to violence due to resource scarcity
2. They can be changed, just like how children raised by ISIS members can be fixed, but to do so is like taming dogs that want to bite you

And for this reason, they continue to display the good sides, even when they know they have done bad things.

The analogy is, firstly, as I stated above, about the children of ISIS members, in which case, they are not that way because they chose that life by their own free will, but because some people messed with their mental faculty, something which couldâ€™ve been done to any of us.

The second analogy is that of how a person who is denied any form of employment, and does not find money begging, will have to turn to robbery just to survive. This was the state of black people soon after slavery was abolished, and people needed DEI policies to escape that state, and that is continuing to this day.

To expand on that, we do provide jobs for black people today, however, they are still supposed to start from a low level, when all the others around them can start from a higher level of life, due to inheritance under the capitalistic economic system, especially in the USA where it is at the extreme, to preserve total liberty and freedom from all moral systems.

For this reason, the difficult fate of the black people is directly due to how they were treated in the past. And DEI is a corrective policy, but corrective policies do not correct everything any more than how the introduction of a medicine for cancer will cure cancer before anyone has had access to it. Only a percentage of the people benefit from DEI at a time, and it takes time to change a whole community.

To go back on the ISIS kids analogy, the reason the children of ISIS members are that way has nothing to do with Westerners, so there is no sense of responsibility if they continue to misbehave. But in the case of black community, their behaviour is a direct result of the conditions once inflicted upon them.

And that is why the Left continues to turn a blind eye to the evil actions committed by black people, similar to how most people turn a blind eye when Muhammadians get persecuted.
