Logic is incomplete on its own.

For example, consider the following expressions.

- Spilling food on the table is bad.
- Bad things must be removed.
- Killing people prevents bad things from happening.
- So those who do bad things should be killed.
- So those who spill food on the table should be killed.

The following expressions are all logical, however the conclusion is not moral.
That is, the conclusion is only valid within these set of statements.

These set of statements are however, only a sub set of events in reality.
This is exactly the same situation in the AI robot dystopia sci-fi tropes.
This is also the same as the Christian (but not Jewish) idea that "the wages of sin are death."

Such a conclusion can only come due to lack of knowledge.
Therefore this clearly cannot come from God.

# Formal Example

A system is described by #todo

# Proof that the whole universe cannot be defined by logic
The state of the system expands as new perspectives enter the system
