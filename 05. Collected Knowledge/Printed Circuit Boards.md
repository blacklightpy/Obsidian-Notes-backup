### Layers
Multiple layers help reduce the size and increase the speed of circuits
- Single layer
- Double layer
- 4 layer
- 6 layer (used in PC motherboards)
- 10 layer
- 12 layer

- Some layers can be used as GND?
- Trace width calculators
- It is difficult to calculate number of layers. Use your intuition. Sometimes it is even hard to calculate the smallest size of the PCB as it is dependent on several parameters - PCB stackup, Vias, number of componenets, placements etc.
- Details:
	- Reliability: Impedance, Total Power Dissipation
	- Size: Dimensions
	- Quality Tests: Reliability features
	- Budget
