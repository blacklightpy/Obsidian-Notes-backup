It is the velocity at which the envelope of a wave's amplitudes propagates through space.

The group velocity $v_g$ is defined as:

$\large v_g = \dfrac{\partial{\omega}}{\partial{k}}$ where $\large \omega$ is the wave's angular frequency and $k$ is it's wavenumber.

The phase velocity is $\large v_p = \omega/k$.

If $\large \omega$ is directly proportional to $\large k$, then the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity. Otherwise they differ by the partial derivative slope.
# Relation to refractive index
Phase velocity: $\large n = c/v_p = ck/\omega$
Group velocity: $\large v_g= \dfrac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \dfrac{c}{n + \omega \dfrac{\partial n}{\partial \omega}}$

The group velocity is only equal to the phase velocity only if the refractive index is independent of the frequency ($\large \dfrac{\partial n}{\partial \omega} = 0$).
