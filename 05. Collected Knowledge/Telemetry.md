Telemetry is often desirable to trace issues with applications and to identify ways in which users might use a program. This is often frowned upon by the privacy conscious community due to the extensive collection of data by companies for surveillance capitalism. However, the situation is not always black and white.

Anyways, telemetry is something that must be done with a good consideration for ethics.
