An identity is created by imagining a boundary.
Think of a TV inside a house.
You could either call it a TV or call the whole thing a house. Or it could just be the entire world.

But doesn't a TV have it's own finite boundary? Actually you'll see it doesn't.
A TV has a finite image as projected onto the retina by the lens. It also has a boundary that you can feel by touch. 
But the image is just the photons emerging from the location of the individual electrons in the TV, projecting back that location. The boundary is just the region where the fields between electrons repel each other strongly to create a force that cannot be passed through.
