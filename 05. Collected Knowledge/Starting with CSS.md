# Tips
- Use a methodology like BEM or SMACSS
- Use a CSS framework, and reuse your layouts
- Use CSS Preprocessors like LESS / SASS / SCSS
- SassScript is the language, and it has parsers for SASS, SCSS and CSS, and converts them into an [[Abstract Syntax Tree]], and convert them into CSS.
- SCSS is more like a superset of CSS, while SASS is a separate language.
