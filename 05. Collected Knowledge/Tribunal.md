A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputes - whether or not it is called a tribunal in its title.

e.g. An advocate in a court could call the judge their tribunal.

The term is derived from [[Tribunes]] - the magistrates of the classic Roman Republic.
