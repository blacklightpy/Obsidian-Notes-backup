Affine geometry is what remains of [[Euclidean Geometry]] when ignoring the [[Metric]] notions such as [[Distance]] and [[Angle]].

Since [[Parallel Lines]] are one of the main properties of geometry that is independent of any metric, it is often considered the study of parallel lines or [[Parallelism]].
