It is commonly confused with balanced cabling, which is a [[Cabling Schemes|cabling scheme]] usually used with differential signalling.

Differential signals have higher headroom due to doubled voltage, by subtracting the opposing wire voltages.

So it is used in low voltage high throughput data channels, such as [[D-PHY]], [[Low Voltage Differential Signalling|LVDS]], etc.

Differential signalling is commonly paired with balanced cabling for noise cancellation.
