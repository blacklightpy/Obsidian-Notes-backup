A choke is an [[Inductor]] used to block (or choke) high frequency AC while passing DC and low frequency AC in a circuit.

The name choke is functional; it is called choke if it is used for blocking or decoupling higher frequencies, but it's simply called an inductor if it is used in electronic filters or tuned circuits.
