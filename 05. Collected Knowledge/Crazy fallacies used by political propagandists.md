## \- All [people of opposing belief 1] are [people of opposing belief 2]
- Pro-Palestinians are commies (claimed by U.S. conservatives)
	- Reality:
		- Most pro-Palestinians are **Muslim conservatives**
		- And others are a **fraction of leftists who believe that Muslims can live in peace provided we do not provoke them**, and believe that many people in Muslim countries would be forced to follow Islam, and they do not deserve to die because surgical strikes are impossible.
		- Some also believe that Hamas came in response to theft of territory, and it would not have happened if Israel did not displace the Palestinians from their homes in 1948.
			- **Counter Argument:**
				- Though it could be reasoned for Israel that even if the beef is with the authorities, it is not possible to attack them without attacking the population, because the authorities are a general representation of the population.
				- And Israel displaced the population without murdering them, which is something Muslims have never done over the years. With Muslim invasions, if the adult males among the dhimmis who are free and healthy wouldn't pay the Jizya tax, they would be imprisoned and abused.
				- That was the purpose of Jizya tax, for the dhimmis to accept the submission to the superior Islamic regime, as per Quran 9:29, which states:
					- **Fight those who believe not in Allah and in the Last Day**,
					- and **who do not forbid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden**,
					- and **who follow not the Religion of Truth among those who were given the Book**,
					- till they **pay the jizyah with a willing hand**,
					- being **humbled.**
- All commies are pro-Palestinians (claimed by U.S. conservatives)
	- Reality:
		- Commies do not care about religion, so some of them share the same viewpoint as Israelis, who are secular, in that the problem is Islamism
- All commies support Palestine because they just want to overthrow the west who are faithful to God
	- Reality:
		- Commies simply find that capitalism destroys most of the population even of the nations that are capitalist, and distributes global wealth to one corner, which is to the hands of those who already have more money. They find that this system is artificial and seeks to change it.
		- Further, they believe the justification of this system comes from the idea of Christianity which states that God blessed these nations to become prosperous, when in reality, they attacked every other nation in the name of said God to become prosperous. This makes them no different from the Muslims, just that they did their part long before the Muslims and achieved their goals of global domination by force.

This is from the belief that all opponents of your ideas share the same beliefs.
This is an example of **victimhood mentality**.

(In this specific case, that the "Christian conservatives", who are the children of God are being attacked by evil godless commies)
## \- As a [person of opposing belief], I believe [claim of said belief] is true
- Even as an atheist I hope your child is with Jesus
- As a Christian I believe the Quran is the true word of Allah

This is a propaganda used to persuade people of opposing beliefs to change their views.
This is an example of **attempted gaslighting**.

("Attempted" because it doesn't really work, and only makes people question their senses)
## \- [People of opposing belief] for [people of said belief] in the name of human decency WHERE [people of said belief] would harm them
- Queers for Palestine

This is from the belief that the enemy of the enemy is your friend.
This is an example of **victimhood mentality**.
