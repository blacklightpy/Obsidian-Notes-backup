## Cryptocurrencies
PoW is the best consesnsus mechanism I can think of. (PoS for example is )

Layer 1: Total power consumed by nodes + Power consumed by miners + Power consumed by transactions
Layer 2: Total power consumed by 2 nodes + Power consumed by transactions
Conversion: Current State: A mess / Can be: SIngle platform solution (like THORSwap)

## Banks 
Digital: Total power consumed by computers in a branch * Number of branches in a bank * Number of banks in a country * Number of countries + Total power consumed by transactions
Currency: Total power consumed by ATMs * ATMs per branch * Number of branches in a bank * Number of banks in a country * Number of countries
Conversion: Forex Platforms + Forex transcations in payment processors

Seems like a cryptocurrency based solution will be more energy efficient (without performing any calculations)
