It is used to create **computers**.

But you will need computers and machines to create them too.

It will need precision, but we'll just zoom it on paper and follow the right practices to construct them.

Firstly, we'll have to learn how to build **basic mechanical manufacturing machines** such as lathes, etc. from scratch. That will involve building modern tools using basic **iron tools**, and making iron tools with other iron tools, which are built with **wooden tools** built with **stone tools** and other stone tools.

For an interesting part, let's look at how to make a big **transistor**. Let's start with the basic logic devices, and find our way to the transistor. They include the **abacus**, **Napier's bones**, and **vacuum tube triodes / thermionic valves** (from Fleming's vacuum tubes).

Vacuum Tubes were based on the observed *thermionic effect* or *Edison effect* of emission of electrons (at that time, current, since electrons weren't discovered) in light-bulbs.

\<FILL: Design Vacuum Tubes, then get to a big transistor. Then miniaturize it.\>
