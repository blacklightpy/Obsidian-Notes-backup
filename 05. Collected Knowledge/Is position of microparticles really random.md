In quantum field theory, electrons are described as fields.

Hence, it makes sense that (even without it) electrons can only be said to have a probability of being in a given region. For normal macroparticles, that probability is based on the center of mass of the object, or the proportion of the particle inside that space.

Why do we have to change this interpretation for electrons? 

# Answer
I figured out the answer to this. Probability obtained from the wavefunction is defined for a region, not for a point.  So the concept of center of mass does not apply here.

In my opinion then, the motion of electrons could be similar to a flowy pattern, but that is just a feeling, which hasn't been tested.
