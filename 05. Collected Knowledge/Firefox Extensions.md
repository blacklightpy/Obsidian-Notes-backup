### Paid Features
For paid extensions, mark features by (P).
If there are differences between the free version and paid version, list those features as `<feature>` (F) / `<feature>` (P)

`Page Type` and `Password` are the features.
### Personal Notes
For personal notes, use `YES` or `NO`. For additional notes, use `*` and mention the references after the list.

For paid extensions, list the notes as `<choice>` (F) / `<choice>` (P). Make the choice as if the extension was free.
Because paid extensions are always disliked for being paid.

Personal notes are marked in the `Personal Notes` field.
## Extra Notes
These include Extension Notes and Personal Notes.

Extension Notes are about the extension itself, and should be marked in any field by by a `*`.
Personal Notes are about my thoughts, and they should be marked in the `Personal Notes` field by a `#`.

They should be expanded upon after the table.
