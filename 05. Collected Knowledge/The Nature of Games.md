Most games have many different possibilities, that it is unrealistic to learn all possible moves. Only a player like Commander Data could win a really complex game with full accuracy (he could even predict how dies would land).

However, it is possible to become a better player by figuring out the ideal moves in a game.

Then there are some games like Tic-Tac-Toe where it is extremely easy to win if you're placing the starting move (or to lose, if you place it wrong).
