## In mathematics (graph theory)
A path in a [[04. Organized Knowledge - Legacy/Science and Engineering/Mathematics/Pure Mathematics/Graph Theory/Graphs|graph]] is a finite or infinite [[sequence]] of [[edge|edges]] which joins a sequence of [[vertex|vertices]] which, by most definitions, are all distinct.

Since the vertices are distinct, so are the edges.
### Terms
#### Walk, trail and path
- Walk: A finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices
- Trail: A walk in which all edges are distinct
- Path: A trail in which all vertices (and hence all edges too) are distinct
#### Directed walk, directed trail, directed path
- Directed walk: A finite or infinite sequence of edges **directed in the same direction** which joins a sequence of vertices
- Directed trail: A **directed** walk in which all edges are distinct
- Directed path: A **directed** trail in which all vertices (and hence all edges too) are distinct
