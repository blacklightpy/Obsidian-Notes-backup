These are patterns in a [[Cellular Automaton]] that has no predecessor. It can be an initial configuration, but it cannot arise in any other way.

These were named after the Garden of Eden in Abrahamic Religions, which were created out of nowhere.

There is no strict definition on GoE patterns, but any pattern containing a GoE pattern itself is a GoE pattern. Hence, as the matrix size tends to infinity, the probability of it being a GoE pattern tends to 1.
