- The universe is created by random
- Life has structure, because that's what formed out of randomness
- The nature of the structure is to propagate itself

- Then what is this life that it propagates
- Feelings are just a chemical reactions

- Well then, do random chemical reactions experience and feel things?
- Maybe they do, and we are enslaving them

- So the logic is slavery
- Slavery is a part of life, the strong prey upon the weak - which is the way of nature.

- If that is the case why must I not kill a human if I'm stronger than them?
- Because the people they care about will fight back

- Why can't I kill a random person who no body cares about, but is innocent

This is only the 
# Precise design
- As far as I'm concerned, the universe is of a precise design.

- But that doesn't mean it was designed by a "god" or a outside creator

- Wi-Fi for example, was not designed by a "designer".
# My view
- I'm not even saying that it is polytheistic

I'm saying that the universe is like a dancer in an outfit.

It is the painter and the painting.
