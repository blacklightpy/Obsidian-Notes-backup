The long range fall off of electromagnetic field strength cannot make electrons drift, just like how sound doesn't move without a medium. However, AC, although it does not transmit power with a reasonable strength wirelessly, can #incomplete 

Also, the impedance of free space is 377 ohms.
$Z_0 = \frac{|E|}{|H|} = 377 \: \text{ohms}$
