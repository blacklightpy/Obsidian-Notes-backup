### Uses
1. Used to smooth out voltage fluctuations on sources
	- a.k.a. bypass cap (since it bypasses the effect of a switched load on supply rail)
	- a.k.a. Decoupling cap (since it decouples AC)
2. Used to block DC
	- a.k.a. Coupling Caps (since it couples AC)
3. Used to filter AC signals

### Types of Capacitors
**Based on polarization**
- Non-polarized
	- Normal double playe symbol
- Polarized
	- Double plate with anode marked
	- Flat plate with anode marked and curved plate
	- Flat plate and curved plate
	- NOTE: Curved plate means negative
**Based on form**
1. Ceramic Disc Capacitors (non-polarized)
2. MLCCs (Multi Layered Ceramic Capacitors) (non-polarized)
3. Electrolytic Capacitors (polarized)
4. Plastic Film Capacitors (non-polarized)

- Ceramic Disc and MLCCs are used for power supply decoupling.
- Electrolytic capacitors are used in parallel and in bulk to filter power supplies.
- Other capacitors are used for their properties like self-healing
