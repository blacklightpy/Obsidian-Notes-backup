They are motivated by the desire for peace among sentient beings, because they themselves have no desire to harm others.

They believe that all those who believe in other things do so either because of indoctrination at a young age, or because they are foolish, or because they wish to control foolish people through their fears to gain power and wealth.

Ironically, in doing so, they assert themselves as superior in terms of intellect and morality, without providing any deeper reason behind such a state. Of course, one element of it comes from how we did not know several truths back when we were not advanced in science, and we explained several things using ideas that seem absurd today. 

However, one mistake in this argument is in the assumption that just because we lacked in scientific knowledge, we also lacked knowledge about the means of epistemology.
