It is a centralized hub used route sound from sources to sinks.

It is used in audio processing systems to connect sound sources to intermediary processing devices before connecting to outputs.

In Linux, [[JACK Audio Connection Kit|JACK]] and [[PipeWire]] are two advanced audio drivers that provide a patchbay. PipeWire simply is a drop-in replacement for both [[PulseAudio]] and JACK by providing backends for them, alongside ALSA.
# Examples
- Carla Patchbay
- qjackctl (JACK GUI based on Qt)
- qpwgraph (Pipewire Graph Manager based on Qt)
- helvum (GTK Patchbay for PipeWire)
- patchmatrix (JACK patchbay in flow matrix style)

A patchbay is different from an [[Audio Mixer]].
