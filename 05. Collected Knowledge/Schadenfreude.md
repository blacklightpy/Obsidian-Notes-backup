Schadenfreude (German: [ˈʃaːdn̩ˌfʁɔʏ̯də]; lit. "harm-joy") is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, pain, suffering, or humiliation of another.

It is the opposite of [[Compersion]].
# In Bible
The Biblical Book of Proverbs mentions an emotion similar to schadenfreude as bad:

"Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him." (Proverbs 24:17–18, KJV)
