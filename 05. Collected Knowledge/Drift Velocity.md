The model of free electrons in a metal is wrong. This was called the Drude model (named after Paul Drude).

In reality, the effect is due to how the electron shells align in a material to form separate bands (conducting and valence), with [[Delocalized Electrons]] being present in the conduction band.

But the Drude model can be used with some corrections even now.
