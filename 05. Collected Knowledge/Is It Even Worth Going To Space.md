- Ionizing Radiation: UV-C, X-Rays, Gamma Rays
- Zero Pressure: Missing the 300 kg/sq.inch of nominal pressure on our body, causing it to inflate and explode
- No Atmosphere: No air for survival
- No Water: No water for survival or hygiene
- No Food: No food for survival
- No Biodiversity: Depressing unnatural environment
- No Gravity: No gravity for normal activities like bathing
- IF other sentient life forms are found: Politics and warfare all over again

But it is still good as an adventure.

Think of the ideas:
- Wormhole transport
- Teleporting
- Spacetime Warping
- Warp Drives
- Space Resources
- Rapid Advancement of Stellar Development by resource sharing
# Warping, potentially creating new universes
Spacetime warping etc. are so high level to learn, so it makes you wonder, if later on we will be interested in creating a new universe from scratch, perhaps in a free space in another dimension?

The idea is that creating a universe in this universe won't be right, and the fact that the universe had an evolutionary path (as signified by our lack of infinite maturity here on Earth) would mean that it was created a finite time ago.

But existence itself seems infinite, so it must have a way of propagating itself. As humanity, we only know of one way, that is reproducing ourselves and sharing knowledge. Perhaps the latter part will be more useful in generating universes, while the former allows our own self to sustain.

Of course, the universe won't just be a simulation, but would be something that grows out organically, using all our knowledge - to the point it will be indistinguishable from magic.

That is, because computer science isn't all, as we have aerospace, mechanical engineering, etc. Even when the industrial revolution came, we used to think clockwork machines would represent the simulation of the universe. But now we think it is computer simulation. The more we learn, we'll learn that the universe itself is the best way to simulate the universe. And that is simply the nature of existence, to create new wonderful experiences.

How interesting to think that possibly divine beings quarreled calling each others sinners?
