Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry obtaining by replacing the parallel postulate with:

> For any given line _R_ and point _P_ not on _R_, in the plane containing both line _R_ and point _P_ there are at least two distinct lines through _P_ that do not intersect _R_.

Hyperbolic geometry is used in the theory of [[Special Relativity]], specifically in the [[Minkowski Model]]
