One way I started having a doubt about it is by my partial understanding of the nature of [[Cellular Automaton|cellular automata]].
# Cellular Automata Model
If we consider a cellular automaton, I don't know for certain whether any configuration cannot arise from any other configuration, or in other words, that all configurations will arise naturally from cellular automata, with the exception of [[Garden of Eden Patterns|Garden of Eden patterns]].

If I could know that for sure, one could say that a universe could either be "natural" or "created".

We would then also have to see if there is any advantage for either case of cellular automata to consider our universe as more reasonable to be either "created" or "natural", when thinking with this framework.

For example, is a Garden of Eden pattern any more alive than the (personally hypothesized) "natural" pattern?

Of course, I'll need to update my way of thinking if there is no one "natural" model.
