When the cow tools comic was published in 1982, it was very controversial because it confused a lot of people. "How can cows make tools?", they asked. So the comic creator Gary Larson of Far Side was forced to put up an explanation for the comic. He said that he hasn't met any cows who've created tools, but he thought that if cows made tools, they would be simple tools like these.

The thing about cow tools is that these are tools made by cows for cows to use. When a cow looks at these tools, it understands them. But when we look at them, we do not understand them, because we are not cows. This is just like how a cow will not understand it when it looks at a table full of human tools.
