It was the set of standards defined by ITU for 3G networks. It was approved as part of the ITU-R recommendation M.1457 (Detailed specifications of the terrestrial radio interfaces of International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000)).

To meet the IMT-2000 standards, a system must provide peak data rates of at 384 Kbit/s for mobile stations and 2 Mbit/s for fixed stations.

There were 5 standards:
1. IMT-2000 CDMA Direct Spread
Also known as: UTRA-FDD, W-CDMA (used in UMTS, the successor to GSM) and UMTS
2. IMT-2000 CDMA Multi-Carrier
Also known as: CDMA2000 (the successor to 2G CDMA (IS-95)), consisting of CDMA2000 1x and 3x, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, CDMA2000 1xEV-DV
3. IMT-2000 CDMA TDD
Also known as: UTRA-TDD (consisting of UTRA TDD 3.84 Mcps High Chip Rate (TD-CDMA), UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps Low Chip Rate (TD-SCDMA)) and UMTS
4. IMT-2000 TDMA Single Carrier
Also known as: EDGE, an intermediate 2.5G technology
5. IMT-2000 FDMA/TDMA (Frequency/Time)
Also known as: DECT
