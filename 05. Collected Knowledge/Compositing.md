Compositing refers to layering of different entities onto a single plane.
Compositing is fundamental to an artwork.

In images and paintings, composition refers to the combination of colours in a scene, which defines the mood of the scene.
In music, sounds of different instruments are composited to form a track.
In poetry, it is the choice of words.
Even when designing a product or during teamwork, each part of the work is composited to form the final result, which when done properly can be defined as a work of art.

Composition is what gives life to an artwork, and what separates it from science.
