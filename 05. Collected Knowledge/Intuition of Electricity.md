> What if charges are not what they seem? What if rather than looking at electric fields separately, maybe charges are simply the aspect of the electromagnetic field that binds it in place, which is why the non-binding aspect of the field does not look like a sink or a source. That makes sense with seeing how electric fields and magnetic field values can vary according to the chosen inertial frame of reference; or in the other sense, for a specific inertial reference frame, the field values vary according to the flow of fields.

- We all know about electron flow
- But what is this electron that flows?
- Moving electric charge creates a magnetic field around it
- That is because changing electric field creates a magnetic field
- Electric charges are just sinks or sources in the electric field
- That, is further due to spacetime warping due to the energy flow causing a charge variation
- (The fields just like to be neutral, so it is like something was taken away)
- Since a voltage moves electrons at a drift velocity, the rate at which the electric field flows is constant
- Since changing electric fields create a magnetic field, the magnetic field itself does not change when the rate of change is constant (that is, after the electric field flow rate has settled, and the magnetic field has risen in proportion)
	- This is not a true effect, no magnetic field is created by the motion. If an electron is moving at a constant velocity in an inertial frame of reference, you could always see it as at rest from another inertial frame of reference. This doesn't change the field.
- If we then change the rate of change of the electric fields, we get a change in the magnetic field.
- That is, changing the velocity of a moving electric charge, by accelerating it
- We can achieve this in one way increasing the voltage repeatedly (since drift velocity depends on the voltage)
- Or we can simply generate alternating current, where the electrons keep changing velocities forwards and backwards
- Since the change in electric field keeps changing, the subsequent magnetic field also keeps changing, and it further generates a change in electric field, and this change keeps propagating outward, and that is what we perceive as electromagnetic radiation.
	- This is a true effect, as the change in velocity implies an acceleration, and hence a change in uniform motion in all reference frames. This change is something new that can flow outwards.

> [!tip] Why is this true?
>  This is actually due to the fact that all thing are in constant motion, and their velocity only depends on the frame of reference. That is, if we choose a different reference frame, a charged particle was still in motion. The measured electric and magnetic fields may change around that region of space, but the electromagnetic field won't as it is a tensor describing the complete field state, regardless of the inertial frame of reference used.

This is because the speed of light is simply the speed at which changes flow. For example, the speed of sound is the speed at which the disturbance in water propagates.

> 	 - **Answer:** Speed of light is fixed, but it is fixed as the same for every observer. This is the result of the Michelson-Morley experiments, when they tried to find the speed of light against the background. So if the speed of light must be same for bodies moving at all velocities, it must mean that at higher velocities, the space must contract to create the same measurement. (The main answer in the link above explains this in terms of geometry better)

# The Lie and The Truth
**Lie:** Moving electric charges create a magnetic field around them

**Truth:** Moving charges don't create field change around them

Applying newton's first law: All things are in a state of rest or uniform motion unless an external force is applied.

Now, this rest is only within a frame of reference. The same body can be seen as moving with a constant velocity from another inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference, even though the body's state of motion wasn't altered by any force.

Similarly, a moving charge can be seen to be at rest if the camera is moving along with it, provided it's not accelerating.

The same charge which previously had a magnetic field around it now doesn't have a magnetic field. What happened? Obviously it's field didn't change. Only what was apparent to you about it changed.

**Outcome:** The way in which you perceive electric and magnetic fields is through relative motion.
